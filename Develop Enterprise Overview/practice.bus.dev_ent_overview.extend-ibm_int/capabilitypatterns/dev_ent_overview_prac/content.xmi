    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>
    Challenge the management team's statements on measurability and feasibility.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Very often, Business goals, and CSF's are not well defined.&amp;nbsp; If this is the case try to convince the management
    team to work on this as their preparation to the Business Focus Workshop.&amp;nbsp; MetaPlan can really help doing this
    effectively and efficiently.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Find out how a business direction process is used in the organization.&amp;nbsp; Find out what management layers have
    influence on a mission, goals, strategy, CSF’s and key performance indicators (KPI) process. Is it a yearly process or
    dynamic, used or put away in a bottom drawer? How is the terminology used?
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Find out if the Management team – especially the members of the HR and marketing organizations – are familiar with
    accessibility standards for their on-line information and services.&amp;nbsp; While your customer may not be under a
    government regulation requiring that it makes its information and services accessible, customers with e-business models
    may recognize substantial brand value from ensuring that their information, services and business processes are
    accessible.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Additionally, where e-Government and e-business are gaining momentum, the accessibility of information and services is
    shifting from solely a regulatory mandate to an explicit element of the organization’s vision and mission.
&lt;/p>&lt;p/>&lt;p>
    &lt;strong>&lt;em>Note:&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>&amp;nbsp; With the increasing degrees of uncertainty brought on by e-business,
    practitioners might wish to familiarize themselves with Stephan Haeckel's book Adaptive Enterprise.&amp;nbsp; Traditional
    concepts regarding strategic direction will be profoundly tested and practitioners should be aware of the changes and
    be able to articulate a required strategy in the new information economy brought on by e-business.&amp;nbsp; The following
    are excerpts from the introduction and first chapter of this book.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    &lt;em>In the information economy brought on by e-business, traditional content within vision, mission, goals etc. is
    changing rapidly and successful companies are articulating strategic directions from a &quot;sense &amp;amp; respond&quot;
    perspective, rather than a &quot;make and sell&quot; perspective, meaning that strategic directions should be based on a highly
    anticipative modular organization with mechanisms that rapidly identify what a customer believes are of value instead
    of trying to predict what customers want, making it and then pushing it to them.&amp;nbsp; The latter is that structure
    follows strategy rather than strategy as structure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    &lt;em>Over time, companies will create a &quot;context&quot; that unambiguously establishes what the firm does and the constraints
    for how it does it.&amp;nbsp; Leaders will specify how employees interrelate to achieve an organization's purpose.&amp;nbsp;
    The elements of the &quot;context&quot; thus established can be seen as analogous to the traditional concepts of mission, policy
    and organization, but with some important differences.&amp;nbsp; As long as the employees stay within the parameters
    defined by the context, the business empowers them to determine for themselves how best to deliver results for which
    they have been made accountable.&amp;nbsp; The result is that context and coordination replace traditional command and
    control.&amp;nbsp; As individuals in the organization adapt to differing customer requests, always staying within the
    current organizational context, leadership actively seeks out environmental and internal signals that will help it
    improve the organizational context itself.&amp;nbsp; What happens is that the sense and respond alternative implies a
    different way in expressing strategy.&amp;nbsp; Once a company organizes itself to recognize current customer needs and
    responds to them, it no longer operates from a strategic plan.&amp;nbsp; Now the DESIGN of its systematic capability to
    respond to unanticipated customer requests expresses its strategy (strategy as a structure as opposed to traditional
    strategic direction where structure follows strategy a process which now takes too long to effectively respond in the
    information economy of e-business).&lt;/em>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Be aware of the language and notation that the client’s organization is using. While this work product uses commonly
    accepted definitions, the terms vision, mission, goals etc. are often used slightly differently.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The company’s culture, structure, maturity or economic positions all define the client’s business direction. The
    strategic direction should ultimately be &quot;grounded&quot;: we consider it to be grounded when it is cascaded throughout the
    organization, processes and functions and is proactively managed.
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    A '&lt;i>high-level&lt;/i>’ understanding is gained of what the enterprise is and aspires to become, how it intends to
    achieve its goals and make the desired transition and by what means. What is included in the business direction depends
    upon the nature of the engagement.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    At a minimum, the company's vision, mission, goals and strategic direction should be understood and documented. It is
    often enough to provide guidance for analysis and alignment of any functional area of a company, including IT, and to
    provide prioritization criteria for initiatives, programs, projects and even modules of a technology package. This is
    because good vision, mission, goal statements and strategic direction usually identify a future view, a description of
    types of offerings and customers, and means to achieve the desired outcome.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    In practice, value propositions, required capabilities and key resources to enable a capability, are replacing the use
    of traditional strategic concepts like Critical Success Factors and Distinctive Competencies.

    of organizing the material.&amp;nbsp; Be realistic about the time needed for the translation of the material (it takes&#xD;
    longer than you think!).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The study will have been successful if an adequate number of responses are obtained, representing complete coverage of&#xD;
    the targeted respondent groups to ensure no skewed results in order to be able to provide insights into the&#xD;

        The processes being analyzed must have already been defined, documented and mapped, showing key activities.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Use subject matter experts to minimize lost time and credibility.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Use the simple tools and techniques to help identify root causes; brainstorming, cause and effect (fishbone)
        diagrams, scatter diagrams, pareto diagrams.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Process flow diagrams are excellent vehicles to enable process analysis - they can be appended with cycle times and
        symbols to indicated problem areas or opportunities for improvement.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Try to do as much analysis at the activity versus the task level.&amp;nbsp; Note: an activity can be manual or
        automated and completes a unit of work.&amp;nbsp; A series of activities are linked together into a workflow to
        accomplish a sub-process that provides a discernible output.&amp;nbsp; Several sub-processes (e.g. provide product /
        service information, provide quotation, etc.) make up a process (e.g. agree contract).
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        There are often many problem areas, so it is key to prioritize these and only undertake root cause analysis on the
        top priority ones.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        There are usually many root causes, so it is key to understand how severe / to what extent these contribute to the
        problem areas.Then only brainstorm ideas to solve the top priority root causes.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Avoid getting bogged down in &quot;analysis paralysis&quot;.

&lt;/ul>&lt;p/>&lt;ul class=&quot;noindent&quot;>
    &lt;li>
        e-business is providing an opportunity to conduct business differently.&amp;nbsp; It is important to understand the

&lt;/ul>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        improving current processes with web technology,

    &lt;li>
        re-engineering their business to take advantage of web technology, or

        reinventing the supply chain and how they deal with their customers and suppliers.&amp;nbsp;

    Beware of diversifying without exploiting the existing market for existing products and services. This can result in
    spreading resources too thinly.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    A product/service marketing strategy is a long-term decision, based on sound knowledge of internal and external
    factors. It may require extensive primary and secondary research. It will require senior management buy-in and
    commitment and sufficient allocated resources. Measurement and control needs to be considered to determine the success
    of the product/service strategy.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Help the client to formulate the product/marketing strategy from an external viewpoint. Sellers often see themselves as

    product/service marketing strategy before committing the company’s resources to tactical actions.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The product/service marketing strategy should be driven by the company’s mission and objectives and balanced against
    constraints, such as internal resources (organization, budget, capability), in light of what is happening in the
    marketplace (customer needs, competitors, environmental factors).
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    Strategic decisions regarding the marketing of individual products and services must be made, just as strategic
    decisions are made for the larger company. The difference is that the scope is more restricted; it is a subset of the
    larger company-wide effort.&amp;nbsp; The product/service marketing strategy is typically focused on two major
    issues—building demand through offerings and customers.&amp;nbsp; Within most markets there are several basic approaches to
    building demand, as shown in the following table:
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    &lt;img height=&quot;269&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;./../../practice.bus.dev_ent_overview.extend-ibm_int/workproducts/resources/marketing_product_service_strategy01.JPG&quot; width=&quot;583&quot; />
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    In some cases, it may also be appropriate to innovate new value delivery systems and/or enter new markets.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    In any case, if management can successfully bring new offerings to market and persuade non-customers to become
    customers for either new or existing offerings, then they have addressed the core issues at the product and service
    level.&amp;nbsp; Strategies for individual products and services must be coordinated with and subordinated to the overall
    company strategy. Management must create, distribute, price and promote their offerings within the context of the
    larger strategy.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Top level managers often delegate many of the product and service marketing strategy decisions, but they should be
    careful to recognize the potential long-term significance of these decisions for the entire company. Careful overview
    and monitoring will ensure that assets are allocated appropriately and that strategic alignment is maintained.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Product and service marketing strategy involves decisions regarding offering definition, target audiences, promotional
    messages and other critical issues. Vast amounts of information are necessary—from inside and outside the company—to
    make customer-pleasing, profitable decisions. Management should ensure that the resources are available to optimize the
    decision-making process and harness relevant information and establish clear direction for those responsible for plan
    execution.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    A distinction must be made between strategy and tactics.&amp;nbsp; The purpose of strategy is to decide upon a future
    state. The purpose of tactics is to define the steps to get there and monitor results. At times the strategic decisions
    will seem to blur into tactics. Nevertheless, management should maintain the distinction. Slipping into a purely
    tactical approach can cause decision-makers to lose sight of the potential of an offering to shape a market and/or its
    role within the larger strategy of the company. This being said, tactics will play a critical role in the ultimate
    outcome. Management must not lose sight of the importance of tactical decisions regarding actual product, price, place
    and promotion decisions.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Strategy is the first concern for product/service-level decision-makers, just as it is for company board members.&amp;nbsp;
    Managers responsible for the product or service must determine what they want for a future state. Once that is
    determined, they can consider tactical actions that will help them achieve their objectives, while remaining aligned
    with the overall company mission. At this point, they begin to deploy assets—people and money—to execute on the
    elements of the marketing mix (product, price, place, and promotion).

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>
    Strategic Positions should be driven by targeting customer needs and wants and then viewed against competition in terms
    of offerings and access.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Ensure that the strategic position provides an adequate statement of where the enterprise stands relative to the
    marketplace, competition, and best practice that will be acceptable to senior management.&amp;nbsp; Check that appropriate
    managers and specialists have been involved in its formulation.&amp;nbsp; If there are gaps in the coverage, understand
    why, communicate to client and determine if gaps are important.&amp;nbsp; Gaps may lead to additional scope of work.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Senior management must agree with the positioning as a basis for more detailed analysis and definition when later
    developing capability models.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Senior Management should review all pertinent positions and decide which ones they want to investigate further within
    the scope of the strategy engagement.&amp;nbsp; Also they should review any issues raised and decide how they want to
    address them.&amp;nbsp; The resolution of these issues may be critical to the strategy; others may have an impact on the
    outcome of the assignment.&amp;nbsp; Other issues may have no impact on the strategy but management may wish to address
    them outside the scope of the engagement.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Rely on senior industry, functional and technical specialists for competitive and market sector information.&amp;nbsp;
    Because of the executive interaction, it requires this experience for credibility.&amp;nbsp; Often they will not be basing
    their findings on detailed analysis, but on judgement and experience applied to sparse information obtained from
    research, a small number of executive interviews and/or workshops.&amp;nbsp; The use of internal specialists at this stage
    will help build their support and commitment to the strategy.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    It is particularly important to gain confidence of management at this early stage in a strategy engagement, and to seek
    their views on how best to proceed, offering some alternatives.&amp;nbsp; The final strategy will be theirs to implement,
    and, as such, their involvement and commitment to the process and the outcome is essential.&amp;nbsp; Special care must be
    given with individuals who feel threatened in any way by the engagement, particularly business unit managers as they
    will be more heavily involved in capability definition and requirements.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Only produce the briefest documents as summaries of the key findings.
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    The analysis of the company's competitive space in the industry is usually along three dimensions: products/services
    (offerings), customers and access. The customer view is driven from customer needs and wants analysis (from CVM). Other
    analytics such as Advantage Curves can, and should when possible, be used to analyze an offering from a customer need
    and cost/margin perspective in relation to competitor offerings.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Positioning is selecting the segments to serve and determining a unique mix of value that the firm intends to deliver
    which will differentiate it from its competitors.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Positioning involves making a selection at two levels:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Segments to participate in.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Selecting the value proposition that will differentiate the firm from its competitors.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    A clearly defined position creates competitive advantage by:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Enabling the firm to focus its capabilities and resources to serve its segments better.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Providing a clear &quot;image,&quot; i.e. &quot;what the company stands for,&quot; to the customers.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Providing clear direction to the management and employees in decision making as well as day to day actions.

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>
    Although logical roles and organizational positions should be considered as different, it is inevitable that there will
    be cases where the two are identical.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    If the Business Structure work product has been produced, the &quot;Logical Locations&quot; identified will provide a starter
    list of locations and may suggest roles.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Roles, job titles, and organizational positions all may exist in many-to-many relationships to each other. Roles can be
    even more granular, such as &quot;opportunity noticer&quot; or &quot;call recorder&quot; - be aware of going to too low a level of detail
    at this stage. You will probably end up with between 10 - 40 roles depending on the scope of the engagement and the
    complexity of the enterprise.
&lt;/p>&lt;p/>&lt;p>
    Physical locations correspond very closely to the ‘location’ concept in the IBM Application Description Standard (ADS)
    for IT systems.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Although this work product defines logical locations, these will usually reflect some aspects of the organizational
    structure and the physical locations.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Various levels of validation are possible:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        walkthrough of the business processes
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        walkthrough of the various organization charts
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        review and verification with client sponsor and executives
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    Business roles are logical, categories of jobs that perform the business activities of the enterprise, (e.g.
    Underwriter, Claims Assessor, Regulator, Loan Recipient, Sales Person). As such, they combine business activities into
    a recognizable relationship with the enterprise. Although these roles will very often appear to be the same as
    positions in the organizational structure, this is not the case and organizational positions will usually perform
    several business roles. Business Roles are strongly related to the functions and activities of the enterprise and are
    defined by the primary function/activity that they perform. So, for example, the &quot;Claims Assessor&quot; role is defined by
    the activity of assessing claims, even though individuals who perform that activity may perform other activities as
    well.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Business locations identify both the physical and logical places, or sites, where the activities of the business are
    carried out. The physical locations are simply the geographical places where the business has a presence; the logical
    locations are classifications, or categories, of these physical sites, based on the types of business activities that
    are performed at them. Examples of logical locations are Head Office, Satellite Branch, Warehouse, Claims Unit,
    Document Reception Center, etc.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Having identified the Roles and Locations, the relationship between these and Business Activities is documented in the
    following matrices: Roles Vs Locations, Roles vs Activities, Locations vs Activities.

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    If the engagement also includes assessment of the current organization, this work product can be completed at a more
    cursory level.&amp;nbsp; The consultant should learn enough from the current organization description to be able to agree
    with the client on what is to be included in the assessment and to set up the assessment activities and schedule.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Alternatively, if the engagement does not include an assessment, the consultant should aim for a thorough description,
    which remains factual and does not extend into evaluative judgments.

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>
    By reviewing industry trends, it is sometimes possible to identify new threats that the client may not have had in
    their radar. Indeed, in some cases the client may have little information on competitors e.g. when attempting to enter
    a new market or to develop a new capability/product/service.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Examine the industry trend of another branch in which parallel situations regarding your client have occurred or will
    take place.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Be creative and investigate whether it is better to join a competitor than beating him. This may look rather odd or not
    a part of the engagement but will bring much better discussion into the steering committee or project group. It also
    shows you’re an expert in the business your client is in.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    It is impractical to research and analyze more than 6 competitors.&amp;nbsp; Narrowing this number done to 3 or 4 focuses
    the research even more and allows an even more in depth review and analysis.&amp;nbsp; In some cases, however, it may be
    necessary to look at many different competitors because they each have unique capabilities or products which the client
    may want to understand or benchmark against.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Ensure that the client is engaged through every point of the analysis.&amp;nbsp; The client should participate in the
    selection of competitors and even more so in the selection of areas of focus for the analysis.&amp;nbsp; Many companies are
    often willing to provide dedicated resources to assist in researching and synthesis.&amp;nbsp; This provides an opportunity
    for some skills transfer.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Competitor analysis may sometimes be a tough sell.&amp;nbsp; A few clients may believe they have a good handle on their
    competitors. Others may already have a dedicated market intelligence team.&amp;nbsp; In such cases, practitioners can still
    bring value to the table by presenting new frameworks for analysis, graphical representations and maybe even new
    information not known to the client.&amp;nbsp; The value also comes in the identification of strategic initiatives to
    address threats and achieve competitive advantage.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Do not rely too much on press releases or other publicly available data.&amp;nbsp; One Competitive Intelligence
    professional notes that only about one third of press releases are reliable.&amp;nbsp; By using industry sources or reports
    by research firms like Gartner or Forrester, practitioners can often get a clearer view of a competitor’s true
    capabilities.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Ethical issues. Be careful that the information you have gathered during other engagements will not mix with a
    competitor analysis engagement. Your client expects confidentiality but will ask you everything about his competitor!
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    First mover. For more than 80 % of the E-business companies a company being first on the market was of first interest.
    Nowadays (June 2001) a competitive analysis helps venture capitalists, board members and all other interest groups to
    make solid decisions.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    If your client claims a competitor analysis is too much, to expensive you should consider the appetizer technique. In
    this it means you can offer the opportunity of conducting a benchmark by using scanning techniques. By using a small
    questionnaire (let’s say 10 important, meaningful questions) the outcome could be that devastating the client wants to
    know more. Examples could be the implementation of a customer friendly portal and the connection with the back office
    or the use of CRM and organizational impact in the insurance market.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Gather information about branches that have gone trough similar changes like your client branch does. Try to find out
    what mistakes competitors have made, learn from that, and translate it to your customers’ branch.

        implement, and, as such, their involvement and commitment to the process and the outcome is essential.&amp;nbsp;
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Senior Management should review all opportunities and threats and decide which ones they want to investigate
        further within the scope of the strategy engagement.&amp;nbsp; Also they should review any issues raised and decide how
        they want to address them.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Special care must be given to individuals who may feel threatened in any way by the engagement, particularly
        business unit managers.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    &lt;strong>Credibility of the analysis:&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        For analysis credibility purposes, rely on senior industry, functional and technical specialists for competitive
        and market sector information. The use of Client’s internal domain specialists at this stage will help build the
        support and commitment to the strategy within the client organization.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Ensure segmentation and other data is current and not obsolete. It is vital that when market data is analyzed and
        used for Industry Environment Analysis, that it is current and reflects the current business environment.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Strategic analysis of industry sector and competitive factors is essential for drawing pertinent business based
        conclusions from internally and externally sourced information and experience.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    &lt;strong>General advice:&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Ask for documented strategy information. Look for vision statement, mission statement, future business goals, list
        of key business drivers, management system (organization, opportunity identification, decision making, funding),
        key target market segments, list of target wants and needs, key value propositions, list of strategic market
        positions, critical success factors, distinctive competencies, critical capabilities.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Ask the client for their business intelligence information on market research, segmentation, and company
        data.&amp;nbsp;
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Be prepared to deal with complex organization structures.&amp;nbsp; For example, if a global company, it may be
        necessary to understand corporate objectives and identify similarities and differences across subsidiaries.&amp;nbsp;
        This may require some or all subsidiaries to be assessed individually.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Only produce the briefest documents as summaries of the key findings.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>
    Strategic Positions should be driven by targeting customer needs and wants and then viewed against competition in terms
    of offerings and access.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Ensure that the strategic position provides an adequate statement of where the enterprise stands relative to the
    marketplace, competition, and best practice that will be acceptable to senior management.&amp;nbsp; Check that appropriate
    managers and specialists have been involved in its formulation.&amp;nbsp; If there are gaps in the coverage, understand
    why, communicate to client and determine if gaps are important.&amp;nbsp; Gaps may lead to additional scope of work.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Senior management must agree with the positioning as a basis for more detailed analysis and definition when later
    developing capability models.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Senior Management should review all pertinent positions and decide which ones they want to investigate further within
    the scope of the strategy engagement.&amp;nbsp; Also they should review any issues raised and decide how they want to
    address them.&amp;nbsp; The resolution of these issues may be critical to the strategy; others may have an impact on the
    outcome of the assignment.&amp;nbsp; Other issues may have no impact on the strategy but management may wish to address
    them outside the scope of the engagement.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Rely on senior industry, functional and technical specialists for competitive and market sector information.&amp;nbsp;
    Because of the executive interaction, it requires this experience for credibility.&amp;nbsp; Often they will not be basing
    their findings on detailed analysis, but on judgement and experience applied to sparse information obtained from
    research, a small number of executive interviews and/or workshops.&amp;nbsp; The use of internal specialists at this stage
    will help build their support and commitment to the strategy.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    It is particularly important to gain confidence of management at this early stage in a strategy engagement, and to seek
    their views on how best to proceed, offering some alternatives.&amp;nbsp; The final strategy will be theirs to implement,
    and, as such, their involvement and commitment to the process and the outcome is essential.&amp;nbsp; Special care must be
    given with individuals who feel threatened in any way by the engagement, particularly business unit managers as they
    will be more heavily involved in capability definition and requirements.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Only produce the briefest documents as summaries of the key findings.
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    The analysis of the company's competitive space in the industry is usually along three dimensions: products/services
    (offerings), customers and access. The customer view is driven from customer needs and wants analysis (from CVM). Other
    analytics such as Advantage Curves can, and should when possible, be used to analyze an offering from a customer need
    and cost/margin perspective in relation to competitor offerings.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Positioning is selecting the segments to serve and determining a unique mix of value that the firm intends to deliver
    which will differentiate it from its competitors.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Positioning involves making a selection at two levels:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Segments to participate in.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Selecting the value proposition that will differentiate the firm from its competitors.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    A clearly defined position creates competitive advantage by:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Enabling the firm to focus its capabilities and resources to serve its segments better.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Providing a clear &quot;image,&quot; i.e. &quot;what the company stands for,&quot; to the customers.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Providing clear direction to the management and employees in decision making as well as day to day actions.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    Other techniques such as the BCG Growth/Market Share Matrix can also be utilized.

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>
    Beware of diversifying without exploiting the existing market for existing products and services. This can result in
    spreading resources too thinly.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    A product/service marketing strategy is a long-term decision, based on sound knowledge of internal and external
    factors. It may require extensive primary and secondary research. It will require senior management buy-in and
    commitment and sufficient allocated resources. Measurement and control needs to be considered to determine the success
    of the product/service strategy.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Help the client to formulate the product/marketing strategy from an external viewpoint. Sellers often see themselves as
    selling an offering; customers see themselves buying value or a solution to a problem.&amp;nbsp; The following graphic
    helps to make the distinction:
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    &lt;img height=&quot;325&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;./../../practice.bus.dev_ent_overview.extend-ibm_int/workproducts/resources/marketing_product_service_strategy1.JPG&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; />&lt;br />

    This work product depends on a variety of inputs which may/may not have been completed. It is important that questions
    are asked, and answers obtained to clarify the company’s overall business strategy.&amp;nbsp; Then, consistency of the
    product/service marketing strategy before committing the company’s resources to tactical actions.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The product/service marketing strategy should be driven by the company’s mission and objectives and balanced against
    constraints, such as internal resources (organization, budget, capability), in light of what is happening in the
    marketplace (customer needs, competitors, environmental factors).
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    Strategic decisions regarding the marketing of individual products and services must be made, just as strategic
    decisions are made for the larger company. The difference is that the scope is more restricted; it is a subset of the
    larger company-wide effort.&amp;nbsp; The product/service marketing strategy is typically focused on two major
    issues—building demand through offerings and customers.&amp;nbsp; Within most markets there are several basic approaches to
    building demand, as shown in the following table:
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    &lt;img height=&quot;269&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;./../../practice.bus.dev_ent_overview.extend-ibm_int/workproducts/resources/marketing_product_service_strategy01.JPG&quot; width=&quot;583&quot; />
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    In some cases, it may also be appropriate to innovate new value delivery systems and/or enter new markets.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    In any case, if management can successfully bring new offerings to market and persuade non-customers to become
    customers for either new or existing offerings, then they have addressed the core issues at the product and service
    level.&amp;nbsp; Strategies for individual products and services must be coordinated with and subordinated to the overall
    company strategy. Management must create, distribute, price and promote their offerings within the context of the
    larger strategy.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Top level managers often delegate many of the product and service marketing strategy decisions, but they should be
    careful to recognize the potential long-term significance of these decisions for the entire company. Careful overview
    and monitoring will ensure that assets are allocated appropriately and that strategic alignment is maintained.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Product and service marketing strategy involves decisions regarding offering definition, target audiences, promotional
    messages and other critical issues. Vast amounts of information are necessary—from inside and outside the company—to
    make customer-pleasing, profitable decisions. Management should ensure that the resources are available to optimize the
    decision-making process and harness relevant information and establish clear direction for those responsible for plan
    execution.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    A distinction must be made between strategy and tactics.&amp;nbsp; The purpose of strategy is to decide upon a future
    state. The purpose of tactics is to define the steps to get there and monitor results. At times the strategic decisions
    will seem to blur into tactics. Nevertheless, management should maintain the distinction. Slipping into a purely
    tactical approach can cause decision-makers to lose sight of the potential of an offering to shape a market and/or its
    role within the larger strategy of the company. This being said, tactics will play a critical role in the ultimate
    outcome. Management must not lose sight of the importance of tactical decisions regarding actual product, price, place
    and promotion decisions.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Strategy is the first concern for product/service-level decision-makers, just as it is for company board members.&amp;nbsp;
    Managers responsible for the product or service must determine what they want for a future state. Once that is
    determined, they can consider tactical actions that will help them achieve their objectives, while remaining aligned
    with the overall company mission. At this point, they begin to deploy assets—people and money—to execute on the
    elements of the marketing mix (product, price, place, and promotion).

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>
    Points to consider in validating that a company has a viable channel strategy are as follows:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Does the channel strategy address the strengths and weaknesses of each channel?
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Is there alignment between the channel strategy and the overall objectives expressed for the product lines and
        brands?
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    Channels are quite complex to evaluate. When evaluating channels, focus on the desirable customer experience and
    customer wants/needs, rather than the technology to support the value proposition.
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    Customers should grow to be familiar and comfortable with the channel so that friction is removed, to the extent
    possible, from the buying process. Through channel strategy, the management team either chooses or adjusts paths to
    market. The Marketing Channel Strategy WPD produces a strategy that helps clients decide how to match customer buying
    expectations to existing and new channels.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Channel strategy has long held its position among the four tenets of marketing-product, price, promotion and place.
    Now, however, channels have come to encompass far more than place alone. Today’s effective distribution channels are
    sophisticated systems focused on the buyer experience. Each entity in the channel is increasingly dependent upon the
    others to deliver &lt;i>perceived&lt;/i> value.

    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        The rise in services, which are more difficult to price.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Accelerating technologies, which make the pricing of frequent complex transactions feasible.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Industry-accepted techniques for building the Measurement Model work product include the Balanced Scorecard approach,&#xD;
    the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) approach, and similar modern analytical methods for objectifying organizational&#xD;
    performance.&amp;nbsp; These techniques are documented in published materials found in References.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are several methods for validating a Measurement Model work product:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;

        &lt;strong>Peer Review&lt;/strong>&#xD;

        An independent consultant with expertise in measurements should participate in a review of the developed&#xD;
        Measurement Model.&amp;nbsp; An independent consultant’s expertise and exposure to various organizations equips him or&#xD;
        her with the experience and insights necessary to validate this critical work product.&amp;nbsp; In addition, the work&#xD;
        product should be reviewed by a technical member of the project team and by a member of the target organization.&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        [Release 2 of the Measurements Catalog provides function for specifying organization-specific policies in the&#xD;
        association between a measurement entity and the organization, resolving a significant problem with reusing&#xD;
        measurement entities presented by Release 1 of the Measurements Catalog.]&#xD;

    &lt;p>&#xD;
        Definitions in the proposed Measurement Model should be compared to definitions for existing entities in the&#xD;
        formally governed publications such as the Global AMS Delivery Measurements Catalog.&amp;nbsp; Measurements that map to&#xD;
        entities in the catalog should be named precisely as they appear in the catalog.&amp;nbsp; New measurements defined in&#xD;
        the measurement model should be added to the catalog and associated with the contributing organization.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;

            “Less is more.” Many measurements in a model do not necessarily make a good model.&amp;nbsp; Through the&#xD;
            prioritization and balancing process of the IBM approach, an optimal minimum number of measurements persist&#xD;
            into the final model.&amp;nbsp; As a result, those measurements should naturally provide a tight coupling to the&#xD;
            target organizations identified business goals.&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Alignment to the defined organizational behaviors.&amp;nbsp; Measurements that do not line up with the defined&#xD;
            organizations behaviors will not persist in the final Measurement Model, unless such retention is required by&#xD;
            specific legal mandates or business policies firmly rooted in the charter (such as a contract) for the&#xD;
            organization.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>The Measurement model describes various attributes about the measurements defined in the model including: &#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Computed Metric&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;

    The term “measurement” as used in this document reflects the sorts of entities that must be elicited when defining and&#xD;
    developing the measurement program and system for an organization.&amp;nbsp; Generally, the term “&lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;

    guid=&quot;_bH3N8CEqEd2LAZ9DC4KJlA&quot;>computed metric&lt;/a>, which involves a calculation among primitive metrics, or a &lt;a&#xD;
