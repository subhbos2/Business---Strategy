    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>
    Challenge the management team's statements on measurability and feasibility.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Very often, Business goals, and CSF's are not well defined.&amp;nbsp; If this is the case try to convince the management
    team to work on this as their preparation to the Business Focus Workshop.&amp;nbsp; MetaPlan can really help doing this
    effectively and efficiently.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Find out how a business direction process is used in the organization.&amp;nbsp; Find out what management layers have
    influence on a mission, goals, strategy, CSF’s and key performance indicators (KPI) process. Is it a yearly process or
    dynamic, used or put away in a bottom drawer? How is the terminology used?
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Find out if the Management team – especially the members of the HR and marketing organizations – are familiar with
    accessibility standards for their on-line information and services.&amp;nbsp; While your customer may not be under a
    government regulation requiring that it makes its information and services accessible, customers with e-business models
    may recognize substantial brand value from ensuring that their information, services and business processes are
    accessible.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Additionally, where e-Government and e-business are gaining momentum, the accessibility of information and services is
    shifting from solely a regulatory mandate to an explicit element of the organization’s vision and mission.
&lt;/p>&lt;p/>&lt;p>
    &lt;strong>&lt;em>Note:&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>&amp;nbsp; With the increasing degrees of uncertainty brought on by e-business,
    practitioners might wish to familiarize themselves with Stephan Haeckel's book Adaptive Enterprise.&amp;nbsp; Traditional
    concepts regarding strategic direction will be profoundly tested and practitioners should be aware of the changes and
    be able to articulate a required strategy in the new information economy brought on by e-business.&amp;nbsp; The following
    are excerpts from the introduction and first chapter of this book.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    &lt;em>In the information economy brought on by e-business, traditional content within vision, mission, goals etc. is
    changing rapidly and successful companies are articulating strategic directions from a &quot;sense &amp;amp; respond&quot;
    perspective, rather than a &quot;make and sell&quot; perspective, meaning that strategic directions should be based on a highly
    anticipative modular organization with mechanisms that rapidly identify what a customer believes are of value instead
    of trying to predict what customers want, making it and then pushing it to them.&amp;nbsp; The latter is that structure
    follows strategy rather than strategy as structure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    &lt;em>Over time, companies will create a &quot;context&quot; that unambiguously establishes what the firm does and the constraints
    for how it does it.&amp;nbsp; Leaders will specify how employees interrelate to achieve an organization's purpose.&amp;nbsp;
    The elements of the &quot;context&quot; thus established can be seen as analogous to the traditional concepts of mission, policy
    and organization, but with some important differences.&amp;nbsp; As long as the employees stay within the parameters
    defined by the context, the business empowers them to determine for themselves how best to deliver results for which
    they have been made accountable.&amp;nbsp; The result is that context and coordination replace traditional command and
    control.&amp;nbsp; As individuals in the organization adapt to differing customer requests, always staying within the
    current organizational context, leadership actively seeks out environmental and internal signals that will help it
    improve the organizational context itself.&amp;nbsp; What happens is that the sense and respond alternative implies a
    different way in expressing strategy.&amp;nbsp; Once a company organizes itself to recognize current customer needs and
    responds to them, it no longer operates from a strategic plan.&amp;nbsp; Now the DESIGN of its systematic capability to
    respond to unanticipated customer requests expresses its strategy (strategy as a structure as opposed to traditional
    strategic direction where structure follows strategy a process which now takes too long to effectively respond in the
    information economy of e-business).&lt;/em>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Be aware of the language and notation that the client’s organization is using. While this work product uses commonly
    accepted definitions, the terms vision, mission, goals etc. are often used slightly differently.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The company’s culture, structure, maturity or economic positions all define the client’s business direction. The
    strategic direction should ultimately be &quot;grounded&quot;: we consider it to be grounded when it is cascaded throughout the
    organization, processes and functions and is proactively managed.
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    A '&lt;i>high-level&lt;/i>’ understanding is gained of what the enterprise is and aspires to become, how it intends to
    achieve its goals and make the desired transition and by what means. What is included in the business direction depends
    upon the nature of the engagement.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    At a minimum, the company's vision, mission, goals and strategic direction should be understood and documented. It is
    often enough to provide guidance for analysis and alignment of any functional area of a company, including IT, and to
    provide prioritization criteria for initiatives, programs, projects and even modules of a technology package. This is
    because good vision, mission, goal statements and strategic direction usually identify a future view, a description of
    types of offerings and customers, and means to achieve the desired outcome.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    In practice, value propositions, required capabilities and key resources to enable a capability, are replacing the use
    of traditional strategic concepts like Critical Success Factors and Distinctive Competencies.

  <org.eclipse.epf.uma:DescriptorDescription xmi:id="-WqOjAhLX0L9c6MI8xD-fiA" name="capability_description,_pPY_w_f2Ed2h5t5KnztE-w" guid="-WqOjAhLX0L9c6MI8xD-fiA">
    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>
    Since capabilities can be described at varying levels of detail, it is important to understand what subsequent analyses
    will be performed with the capabilities and their descriptions.&amp;nbsp; This should dictate the level and detail of the
    description.&amp;nbsp; For example, capabilities identified during an e-Design engagement will normally comprise a far more
    detailed description of a firm or business initiative than those defined for a strategy engagement.&amp;nbsp; The
    difference in detail arises because when we are working to define an e-business strategy, we are interested in the
    commonality and differentiation among a set of e-business initiatives.&amp;nbsp; In this situation, we need only identify
    the most obvious and most significant capabilities that comprise the initiatives.&amp;nbsp; However, when we are optimizing
    the design of one of those initiatives, it is necessary to work from a much more detailed decomposition of an
    initiative into its constituent capabilities.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    When defining capabilities for a firm, confusion can arise over the level of detail at which the capabilities should be
    defined.&amp;nbsp; The capability, “Ability to generate awareness” describes a very general characteristic of most
    firms.&amp;nbsp; In contrast, “Ability to access market demographics” is a more detailed capability that often appears in
    support of the former capability.&amp;nbsp; It need not be identified unless it also supports other capabilities.&amp;nbsp; The
    level detail of the capability should be dictated by the needs of the engagement and the agreed to scope.&amp;nbsp;
    Obviously, the more general capabilities can be identified far easier than the more detailed capabilities.&amp;nbsp; A
    careful review of identified capabilities, whether new or existing, should be performed to ensure that a “common level”
    has been achieved.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Describing capabilities should be an iterative process.&amp;nbsp; As stated above, a capability may be described at a
    high-level during the initial activities within a strategy (sufficient amount of detail to make the relevant decisions)
    and then further refined and described in later activities and fully detailed during e-Design (to support the design
    and eventual implementation of a supported initiative).&lt;br />
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    &lt;i>A &lt;strong>Capability&lt;/strong>&lt;/i> identifies any combination of knowledge, organization, process, and technology
    (Capability Enablers/Resources or KOPT) [We will use the shorthand KOPT to refer to these in the remainder of this
    document]. Also note, Capability Enabler and Resource both refer to KOPT.) that enables a firm (or business unit) to
    deliver a specific value proposition &lt;i>directly&lt;/i> to a defined segment [A Segment is defined as a collection of
    firms or individuals that have similar wants and needs from the perspective of the focal (client’s) firm.] of
    stakeholders, e.g., customer segment or supplier segment, or &lt;i>indirectly&lt;/i> through the support of other
    capabilities.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    &lt;img height=&quot;190&quot; alt=&quot;Capability&quot; src=&quot;./../../practice.bus.bus_proc_gov.extend-ibm_int/workproducts/resources/cap1.GIF&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; />
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The internal components of a given capability can vary from firm to firm. For example, several firms may be observed to
    be capable of delivering the same value propositions; therefore, each of these firms may be described as having the
    same capability. When analyzed in more detail and compared across firms, each of these firms may have developed or
    configured a very different set of KOPT in its own unique capability. This identifies an important use and
    characteristic of capabilities: they provide a scheme whereby the similarities across firms or business models can be
    identified while the details of the differences among firms can be preserved.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    More specifically, a capability’s title provides a label for a firm’s collection of specific KOPT commissioned to
    support the delivery of specific value propositions. These labels or titles should be assigned so as to allow for
    identification of similarities. The capability description adds the details of a particular firm’s KOPT, identifying
    more detailed similarities and differences among specific capabilities that each support the delivery of the same value
    propositions.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Since in subsequent analyses we may need to know those capabilites which &lt;i>directly&lt;/i> support value propositions, we
    refer to these as &lt;u>&lt;i>Externally Focused Capabilities&lt;/i>&lt;/u>. These Capabilites are externally focused and directly
    support a value proposition to one or more segments. Capabilites that &lt;i>indirectly&lt;/i> support value propositions
    through other capabilites are referred to as &lt;u>&lt;i>Internally Focused Capabilities&lt;/i>&lt;/u>. These capabilites are
    internally focused and support other capabilities. Occassionally, capabilities will be observed to support value
    propositions directly and support value propositions through other capabilities. These capabilities are labeled as both
    External Focused and Internally Focused.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    &lt;img height=&quot;114&quot; alt=&quot;Capability&quot; src=&quot;./../../practice.bus.bus_proc_gov.extend-ibm_int/workproducts/resources/cap2.GIF&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; />
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Capabilities are usually described in the format:
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    &lt;b>For example: &quot;Ability to access information&quot;&lt;/b>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Examples of capabilities that enable all major Value Net Players [A Value Net Player is defined as one of the following
    - Customer, Supplier, Competitor/Substitute or Complementor]. For more information on Value Nets, refer to the Value
    Exchange Technique Paper:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Ability to access customer information
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Ability to generate customer awareness
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Ability to source high quality components
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Ability to create and maintain partnerships and alliances
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Ability to quickly identify and analyze competitor actions in the marketplace
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Ability to dynamically source capacity from competitors
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    Numerous combinations of KOPT can deliver capabilities as indicated by the diversity in management systems, skills,
    intellectual capital, organizational design and process implementations across firms. In general, there is no &quot;one-way&quot;
    of delivering a capability. Indeed, there may be no &quot;best-way&quot; of delivering a capability for all firms. What is best
    for any given firm may depend to a large degree on the other capabilities (and supporting KOPT) that are available in
    that firm. This flexibility is part of the strength of using capabilities versus other more detailed and specific
    representations. The primary advantages of Capabilities are:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
    &lt;li>
        Avoidance of the tactical detail that may cloud a strategic decision, since capabilities are an abstraction of
        KOPT,
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Avoidance of the myopic (restricted) focus on delivering value in one and only one manner. It allows the client to
        explore multiple options for delivering the value.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>
    In the most simplistic usage, capabilities identify the essential components of a proposed new business initiative. In
    this instance, the minimal description of a capability is needed, including only the value produced and not requiring
    the details of its Capability Enablers (KOPT). If additional information on the Capability Enablers (KOPT) is
    available, it should be captured during the current task or later in follow-on tasks. In general, many analyses
    involving capabilities will employ the details describing the Capability Enablers.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The most detailed capability descriptions contains information about Capability Enablers including:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Processes that are in place or would need to be in place to deliver the value produced by the capability
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        What knowledge and skills the organization must have, including any critical information or data
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        The organization required in terms of roles and responsibilities and critical management practices and policies
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Technology deployed or necessary to enable this capability including classes of applications that would be required
        and any necessary technical infrastructure
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></refinedDescription>

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>
    &lt;strong>Scope of Analysis&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Capability Model Definition provides a valuable tool for decision making from its highest level, depicting how
    capabilities support value propositions and offerings, to its lowest level of a fully prioritized, linked and
    correlated set of capabilities and enablers required to support a business design.&amp;nbsp; The challenge for the
    project/engagement manager, is to decide where to set the scope and boundaries for analysis at each phase of the
    engagement.&amp;nbsp; The following provides a rough guide for determining how detailed a work product will be produced:
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    &lt;strong>Strategy:&lt;/strong> The work product includes the capabilities identified and correlated for strategic
    opportunities, in support of a given business design for profitability and sustained advantage.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    &lt;strong>Design:&lt;/strong> The work product includes prioritized capabilities and enablers for the purpose of design
    optimization, investment and resource allocation and release planning to deliver the initiatives in the strategic
    roadmap.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    &lt;strong>Business Design Context Sensitivity&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The Capability Model Definition is relevant in the context of a set of value exchanges positioned in an external
    environment. As market segment sizes change, buyer preferences shift, the value a firm can derive from a particular
    offering can change dramatically. Capabilities which have led to sustainable advantage in the past, may not do so in
    the future because of their relevance to external forces.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The Capability Model Definition work product
    forms a basis for the continuous assessment of these external dynamics on internal workings, and provides the means to
    avoid a failure of the firm’s business design.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    &lt;br />
    &amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    The Capability Model Definition work product depicts an integrated framework of a firm’s capabilities. This integrated
    framework&amp;nbsp;shows how, and to what extent, these capabilities interact with and affect one another, in serving the
    value exchanges (where a product or service is exchanged for something of value) between the firm and its customers and
    other external value net players (Partners, Suppliers, Channels, etc.). The framework also shows the degree to which
    capabilities positively reinforce one another, or negatively impede one another, and the direction of cause and effect
    between related capabilities. In its most detailed form, this integrated framework shows how enablers combine to serve
    one or more capabilities. The Capability Model Definition represents those critical things that a firm must be capable
    of doing well to insure the performance of its business design.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    At its most detailed, the Capability Model Definition work product will describe a framework comprising four layers:
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    &lt;img height=&quot;455&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;./../../practice.bus.bus_proc_gov.extend-ibm_int/workproducts/resources/capmoddesc1.JPG&quot; width=&quot;570&quot; />
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The Capability Model Definition work product distinguishes between three types of capability, namely external
    capabilities, supporting capabilities, and common capabilities.
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>External capabilities&lt;/strong> directly support value exchanges with external value net players. These
        capabilities tend to be Value Net Player specific, such as capabilities for suppliers, or even segment specific,
        capabilities specific to large wholesale customers.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    &lt;img height=&quot;445&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;./../../practice.bus.bus_proc_gov.extend-ibm_int/workproducts/resources/capmoddesc2.JPG&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; />
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Supporting capabilities&lt;/strong> – the internal capabilities which support the external capabilities. These
        are normally value net player and segment specific.&amp;nbsp; Their relationship to value exchanges are indirect.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    &lt;img style=&quot;WIDTH: 600px; HEIGHT: 451px&quot; height=&quot;445&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;./../../practice.bus.bus_proc_gov.extend-ibm_int/workproducts/resources/capmoddesc3.JPG&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; />
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Core capabilities&lt;/strong> are those upon which the whole business depends.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;They include
        internal capabilities that directly or indirectly support external capabilities and which are reusable across two
        or more value net player groups. This third class of capabilities would include the enterprise architecture
        capabilities, such as enterprise wide data integrity management.&amp;nbsp;
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>&lt;img height=&quot;470&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;./../../practice.bus.bus_proc_gov.extend-ibm_int/workproducts/resources/capmoddesc4.JPG&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /> 
&lt;p>
    The Capability Model Definition work product can be used to depict the ‘As Is’ state, but is more typically developed
    for the ‘To Be’ state.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    A completed Capability Model Definition work product can be used to depict the capabilities for a complete enterprise,
    or an individual Line of Business (LOB).

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>
    One of the outputs of the change management workshop should be the identification of some key individuals who will
    drive the change in the&amp;nbsp;target organization.&amp;nbsp; After the initial contact with these individuals, do not leave
    a gap in your communication with them until the assessment is complete.&amp;nbsp; These leaders should meet with project
    management early in the project to review the charter, project overview, guiding principles, and project team
    organization.&amp;nbsp; Ideally they should come to identify themselves as members (core or extended) of the project team
    and should work side by side with the team for the duration of the project.&amp;nbsp; The success or failure of the program
    will depend on the ability of all the project management team to:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Encourage effective sponsorship of the changes
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Encourage all individuals to own the changes
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Manage the resistance to the change by effective issues management
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>&lt;p/>&lt;p>
    Be prepared before any meetings with sponsors and key stakeholders to speak comfortably about the role that they
    ideally should play.&amp;nbsp; Every conversation with a sponsor is an opportunity to encourage and coach them.&amp;nbsp;
    Sponsors are individuals who sanction the project and they should be actively involved in its progress.&amp;nbsp; Change
    sponsors must provide leadership to ensure that the process of change takes place successfully.&amp;nbsp; They must
    legitimize the change, provide a clear vision of what must occur, and be willing to demonstrate the organizational
    commitment necessary to execute and complete the project successfully.&amp;nbsp; Significant and successful change within a
    target population will not occur without effective and sustained sponsorship.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Key client sponsors need to understand the conclusions and evaluate and agree to the recommendations before they are

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>
    Since capabilities can be described at varying levels of detail, it is important to understand what subsequent analyses
    will be performed with the capabilities and their descriptions.&amp;nbsp; This should dictate the level and detail of the
    description.&amp;nbsp; For example, capabilities identified during an e-Design engagement will normally comprise a far more
    detailed description of a firm or business initiative than those defined for a strategy engagement.&amp;nbsp; The
    difference in detail arises because when we are working to define an e-business strategy, we are interested in the
    commonality and differentiation among a set of e-business initiatives.&amp;nbsp; In this situation, we need only identify
    the most obvious and most significant capabilities that comprise the initiatives.&amp;nbsp; However, when we are optimizing
    the design of one of those initiatives, it is necessary to work from a much more detailed decomposition of an
    initiative into its constituent capabilities.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    When defining capabilities for a firm, confusion can arise over the level of detail at which the capabilities should be
    defined.&amp;nbsp; The capability, “Ability to generate awareness” describes a very general characteristic of most
    firms.&amp;nbsp; In contrast, “Ability to access market demographics” is a more detailed capability that often appears in
    support of the former capability.&amp;nbsp; It need not be identified unless it also supports other capabilities.&amp;nbsp; The
    level detail of the capability should be dictated by the needs of the engagement and the agreed to scope.&amp;nbsp;
    Obviously, the more general capabilities can be identified far easier than the more detailed capabilities.&amp;nbsp; A
    careful review of identified capabilities, whether new or existing, should be performed to ensure that a “common level”
    has been achieved.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Describing capabilities should be an iterative process.&amp;nbsp; As stated above, a capability may be described at a
    high-level during the initial activities within a strategy (sufficient amount of detail to make the relevant decisions)
    and then further refined and described in later activities and fully detailed during e-Design (to support the design
    and eventual implementation of a supported initiative).&lt;br />
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    &lt;i>A &lt;strong>Capability&lt;/strong>&lt;/i> identifies any combination of knowledge, organization, process, and technology
    (Capability Enablers/Resources or KOPT) [We will use the shorthand KOPT to refer to these in the remainder of this
    document]. Also note, Capability Enabler and Resource both refer to KOPT.) that enables a firm (or business unit) to
    deliver a specific value proposition &lt;i>directly&lt;/i> to a defined segment [A Segment is defined as a collection of
    firms or individuals that have similar wants and needs from the perspective of the focal (client’s) firm.] of
    stakeholders, e.g., customer segment or supplier segment, or &lt;i>indirectly&lt;/i> through the support of other
    capabilities.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    &lt;img height=&quot;190&quot; alt=&quot;Capability&quot; src=&quot;./../../practice.bus.bus_proc_gov.extend-ibm_int/workproducts/resources/cap1.GIF&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; />
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The internal components of a given capability can vary from firm to firm. For example, several firms may be observed to
    be capable of delivering the same value propositions; therefore, each of these firms may be described as having the
    same capability. When analyzed in more detail and compared across firms, each of these firms may have developed or
    configured a very different set of KOPT in its own unique capability. This identifies an important use and
    characteristic of capabilities: they provide a scheme whereby the similarities across firms or business models can be
    identified while the details of the differences among firms can be preserved.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    More specifically, a capability’s title provides a label for a firm’s collection of specific KOPT commissioned to
    support the delivery of specific value propositions. These labels or titles should be assigned so as to allow for
    identification of similarities. The capability description adds the details of a particular firm’s KOPT, identifying
    more detailed similarities and differences among specific capabilities that each support the delivery of the same value
    propositions.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Since in subsequent analyses we may need to know those capabilites which &lt;i>directly&lt;/i> support value propositions, we
    refer to these as &lt;u>&lt;i>Externally Focused Capabilities&lt;/i>&lt;/u>. These Capabilites are externally focused and directly
    support a value proposition to one or more segments. Capabilites that &lt;i>indirectly&lt;/i> support value propositions
    through other capabilites are referred to as &lt;u>&lt;i>Internally Focused Capabilities&lt;/i>&lt;/u>. These capabilites are
    internally focused and support other capabilities. Occassionally, capabilities will be observed to support value
    propositions directly and support value propositions through other capabilities. These capabilities are labeled as both
    External Focused and Internally Focused.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    &lt;img height=&quot;114&quot; alt=&quot;Capability&quot; src=&quot;./../../practice.bus.bus_proc_gov.extend-ibm_int/workproducts/resources/cap2.GIF&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; />
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Capabilities are usually described in the format:
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    &lt;b>For example: &quot;Ability to access information&quot;&lt;/b>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Examples of capabilities that enable all major Value Net Players [A Value Net Player is defined as one of the following
    - Customer, Supplier, Competitor/Substitute or Complementor]. For more information on Value Nets, refer to the Value
    Exchange Technique Paper:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Ability to access customer information
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Ability to generate customer awareness
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Ability to source high quality components
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Ability to create and maintain partnerships and alliances
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Ability to quickly identify and analyze competitor actions in the marketplace
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Ability to dynamically source capacity from competitors
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    Numerous combinations of KOPT can deliver capabilities as indicated by the diversity in management systems, skills,
    intellectual capital, organizational design and process implementations across firms. In general, there is no &quot;one-way&quot;
    of delivering a capability. Indeed, there may be no &quot;best-way&quot; of delivering a capability for all firms. What is best
    for any given firm may depend to a large degree on the other capabilities (and supporting KOPT) that are available in
    that firm. This flexibility is part of the strength of using capabilities versus other more detailed and specific
    representations. The primary advantages of Capabilities are:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
    &lt;li>
        Avoidance of the tactical detail that may cloud a strategic decision, since capabilities are an abstraction of
        KOPT,
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Avoidance of the myopic (restricted) focus on delivering value in one and only one manner. It allows the client to
        explore multiple options for delivering the value.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>
    In the most simplistic usage, capabilities identify the essential components of a proposed new business initiative. In
    this instance, the minimal description of a capability is needed, including only the value produced and not requiring
    the details of its Capability Enablers (KOPT). If additional information on the Capability Enablers (KOPT) is
    available, it should be captured during the current task or later in follow-on tasks. In general, many analyses
    involving capabilities will employ the details describing the Capability Enablers.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The most detailed capability descriptions contains information about Capability Enablers including:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Processes that are in place or would need to be in place to deliver the value produced by the capability
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        What knowledge and skills the organization must have, including any critical information or data
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        The organization required in terms of roles and responsibilities and critical management practices and policies
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Technology deployed or necessary to enable this capability including classes of applications that would be required
        and any necessary technical infrastructure
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></refinedDescription>

    &lt;strong>Scope of Analysis&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Capability Model Definition provides a valuable tool for decision making from its highest level, depicting how
    capabilities support value propositions and offerings, to its lowest level of a fully prioritized, linked and
    correlated set of capabilities and enablers required to support a business design.&amp;nbsp; The challenge for the
    project/engagement manager, is to decide where to set the scope and boundaries for analysis at each phase of the
    engagement.&amp;nbsp; The following provides a rough guide for determining how detailed a work product will be produced:
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    &lt;strong>Strategy:&lt;/strong> The work product includes the capabilities identified and correlated for strategic
    opportunities, in support of a given business design for profitability and sustained advantage.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    &lt;strong>Design:&lt;/strong> The work product includes prioritized capabilities and enablers for the purpose of design
    optimization, investment and resource allocation and release planning to deliver the initiatives in the strategic
    roadmap.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    &lt;strong>Business Design Context Sensitivity&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The Capability Model Definition is relevant in the context of a set of value exchanges positioned in an external
    environment. As market segment sizes change, buyer preferences shift, the value a firm can derive from a particular
    offering can change dramatically. Capabilities which have led to sustainable advantage in the past, may not do so in
    the future because of their relevance to external forces.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The Capability Model Definition work product
    forms a basis for the continuous assessment of these external dynamics on internal workings, and provides the means to
    avoid a failure of the firm’s business design.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    &lt;br />
    &amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    The Capability Model Definition work product depicts an integrated framework of a firm’s capabilities. This integrated
    framework&amp;nbsp;shows how, and to what extent, these capabilities interact with and affect one another, in serving the
    value exchanges (where a product or service is exchanged for something of value) between the firm and its customers and
    other external value net players (Partners, Suppliers, Channels, etc.). The framework also shows the degree to which
    capabilities positively reinforce one another, or negatively impede one another, and the direction of cause and effect
    between related capabilities. In its most detailed form, this integrated framework shows how enablers combine to serve
    one or more capabilities. The Capability Model Definition represents those critical things that a firm must be capable
    of doing well to insure the performance of its business design.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    At its most detailed, the Capability Model Definition work product will describe a framework comprising four layers:
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    &lt;img height=&quot;455&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;./../../practice.bus.bus_proc_gov.extend-ibm_int/workproducts/resources/capmoddesc1.JPG&quot; width=&quot;570&quot; />
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The Capability Model Definition work product distinguishes between three types of capability, namely external
    capabilities, supporting capabilities, and common capabilities.
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>External capabilities&lt;/strong> directly support value exchanges with external value net players. These
        capabilities tend to be Value Net Player specific, such as capabilities for suppliers, or even segment specific,
        capabilities specific to large wholesale customers.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    &lt;img height=&quot;445&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;./../../practice.bus.bus_proc_gov.extend-ibm_int/workproducts/resources/capmoddesc2.JPG&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; />
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Supporting capabilities&lt;/strong> – the internal capabilities which support the external capabilities. These
        are normally value net player and segment specific.&amp;nbsp; Their relationship to value exchanges are indirect.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    &lt;img style=&quot;WIDTH: 600px; HEIGHT: 451px&quot; height=&quot;445&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;./../../practice.bus.bus_proc_gov.extend-ibm_int/workproducts/resources/capmoddesc3.JPG&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; />
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Core capabilities&lt;/strong> are those upon which the whole business depends.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;They include
        internal capabilities that directly or indirectly support external capabilities and which are reusable across two
        or more value net player groups. This third class of capabilities would include the enterprise architecture
        capabilities, such as enterprise wide data integrity management.&amp;nbsp;
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>&lt;img height=&quot;470&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;./../../practice.bus.bus_proc_gov.extend-ibm_int/workproducts/resources/capmoddesc4.JPG&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /> 
&lt;p>
    The Capability Model Definition work product can be used to depict the ‘As Is’ state, but is more typically developed
    for the ‘To Be’ state.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    A completed Capability Model Definition work product can be used to depict the capabilities for a complete enterprise,
    or an individual Line of Business (LOB).

    The Process Capabilities may be identified at the process group, process, sub-process or activity level and address
    process design points (major process elements) and process capabilities.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The Process Capabilities Definition Work Product:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Identifies and describes, with text and graphics, the design points of the process and its sub-processes

        Process Scenarios developed in this work product will be at a high level and for example will not include

&lt;p>
    Extensive preparation before the Scenario Development Workshop is necessary to create the necessary tools and
    environment.&amp;nbsp; Education at both the executive and working team levels is critical to successful scenario
    development as it will make them more knowledgeable and productive throughout the process, and will help set realistic
    expectations.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    In instances where new scenario development is not feasible or desired, consideration should be given to using
    previously developed scenarios (by industry, industry segment, business area, etc.) as available.
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    The Process Scenarios describes a sequence of events, triggers, actors, inputs/outputs, and business rules that govern
    segments or paths of a process associated to each area of business operations.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The work product applies to business processes within an enterprise and outside an enterprise, such as processes
    performed with business partners. It also applies to IT processes as well as IT support processes related to things
    like systems management and help desk.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Process Scenarios enhance client understanding of the future business solution by relating processes to daily business
    activities. They act as a means of positively communicating business process enablers as well as set expectations as to
    the limitations of the package or technology to be used.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The design team should have a clear understanding of the scope of the engagement, the business strategy and desired
    capabilities. The project team should also have a common high-level understanding of the major process changes to be
    implemented.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Process Scenarios help the design team understand the needs of their client and the functions that will meet those
    needs.

    &lt;strong>Key Points&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        If the scope of the project is driven by the client's business strategies/goals and/or customer imperatives, output
        of the Process Assessment work product should directly support the process selection with rationale such as process
        performance and process importance in achieving business goals and / or customer sat.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        In a transformation project do not waste time at this stage in developing current process models / maps to a
        detailed level (identification of sub-processes (level 2) is sufficient to do an assessment, whereas level 3 (or 4)
        is required for analysis)
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        It is useful to get different views of importance / performance if you can, e.g. customers, suppliers, business
        partners, employees, etc.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Select the appropriate assessments based on client objectives / nature of the engagement, don't try and do them
        all!
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        The better you can prepare before the workshop, the more productive each workshop will be.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Use subject matter experts to minimize lost time and credibility.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Use the simple tools and techniques to help identify root causes; brainstorming, cause and effect (fishbone)
        diagrams, scatter diagrams, Pareto Analysis.

        &lt;strong>Operations assessment&lt;/strong> is a methodical process of analyzing how employee skill sets, business
        processes, and existing information systems function. The result is a comprehensive assessment of how effectively a
        company uses resources and how well its operating units perform.

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>
    When facilitating the process or capability assessment exercise, allow client team members to use a more granular
    rating scale (i.e. L+, H-, etc.).&amp;nbsp; This will also help achieve a consensus opinion on the rating of each
    assessment category and goal linkage.&amp;nbsp; In some e-strategy engagements the assessment may be as simple as
    identifying it as a strength or weakness and then providing some descriptions as to the weakness and potential
    corrective actions rather than even doing high level process flows.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    If the scope of a transformation project is driven by the client’s business strategies/goals and/or customer
    imperatives, output of the &quot;As-Is&quot; Process or Capability Assessment work product should directly support the process or

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>
    Some critical success factors for developing this work product include:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
    &lt;li>
        Stay at as high a level as possible.&amp;nbsp; Do not waste time developing detailed process models or detailed
        descriptions at this point (include just enough description so people can agree on the boundaries and distinguish
        one process from another).
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Ensure that the differences between business management functions and processes are understood by IBM and the
        client.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        The number of businesses' processes should be around twenty to twenty five (if covering the entire enterprise) or
        between six and twelve (if covering the day-to-day business operations area) to achieve the right level of
        granularity.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Ensure a reasonably high level of consensus exists among client participants relative to the process names,
        descriptions, etc.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Identify potential sources of information before any client workshop, e.g., ICM database, ISU &quot;files&quot;, subject
        matter experts, competency networks; and through literature searches - competitive intelligence library at Mt.
        Pleasant, NY, Industry benchmark databases, industry consortiums, infogate, internet, etc; and within the client's
        organization in the form of prior work, operating guidelines, ISO or TQM documentation, etc.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Prepare a &quot;straw model&quot; of the processes/descriptions to be defined in the workshop.&amp;nbsp; This is a useful
        technique to ensure proper preparation and insight into the workshop focus area.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Whenever possible, start with a generic or industry standard process model (even if the client has his own model)
        to minimize development time and/or use as a benchmark for completeness and clarity.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Try to identify and involve the client's &quot;process architect&quot; or a fairly high level staff manager with broad
        knowledge of the client's business (who also understands business processes) to represent an objective view of the
        processes.
    &lt;/li>

&lt;p>
    &lt;strong>Major Dependencies:&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
    &lt;li>
        Client contact(s) with broad understanding of the business from a process perspective.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Involvement of client, vendor or IBM personnel with a general knowledge of the selected package's functional
        capabilities (if applicable).
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Knowledge of client's key business goals/objectives, customer imperatives and/or business process performance

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>
    One of the outputs of the change management workshop should be the identification of some key individuals who will
    drive the change in the&amp;nbsp;target organization.&amp;nbsp; After the initial contact with these individuals, do not leave
    a gap in your communication with them until the assessment is complete.&amp;nbsp; These leaders should meet with project
    management early in the project to review the charter, project overview, guiding principles, and project team
    organization.&amp;nbsp; Ideally they should come to identify themselves as members (core or extended) of the project team
    and should work side by side with the team for the duration of the project.&amp;nbsp; The success or failure of the program
    will depend on the ability of all the project management team to:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Encourage effective sponsorship of the changes
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Encourage all individuals to own the changes
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Manage the resistance to the change by effective issues management
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>&lt;p/>&lt;p>
    Be prepared before any meetings with sponsors and key stakeholders to speak comfortably about the role that they
    ideally should play.&amp;nbsp; Every conversation with a sponsor is an opportunity to encourage and coach them.&amp;nbsp;
    Sponsors are individuals who sanction the project and they should be actively involved in its progress.&amp;nbsp; Change
    sponsors must provide leadership to ensure that the process of change takes place successfully.&amp;nbsp; They must
    legitimize the change, provide a clear vision of what must occur, and be willing to demonstrate the organizational
    commitment necessary to execute and complete the project successfully.&amp;nbsp; Significant and successful change within a
    target population will not occur without effective and sustained sponsorship.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Key client sponsors need to understand the conclusions and evaluate and agree to the recommendations before they are
    carried forward into the subsequent work product, Transition Management Strategy.&amp;nbsp; Closely involve broad
    representation from management throughout the process, and seek input from multiple client sources.&amp;nbsp; Most of the
    content for this work product will be collected through discussions and events with clients at different levels of the
    organization.&amp;nbsp; Prepare for the reviews by anticipating their reactions to the conclusions and increasing your
    knowledge of and comfort with the supporting data.&amp;nbsp; Client team members should be involved in both the development
    and review of the report.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Be careful to consolidate data collection needs so as not to have multiple interviews with client employees, especially
    with executives.

    Modeling business processes has no value in itself.&amp;nbsp; It provides the basis for understanding and analysis that can
    help clients identify opportunities to improve performance and operational effectiveness whether it’s through
    continuous improvement, re-engineering, repairing broken processes or transforming the business. The aim should be to
    help the client develop a process which:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Is responsive to executive goals
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Represents a fundamental rethinking of how work is done
    &lt;/li>

        Is concrete enough for the following to be easily understood
    &lt;/li>

        &lt;/ul>
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Integrates organization learning
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
    Make sure you understand the level of change the client is looking for.&amp;nbsp; There is a lot of confusion in
    terminology surrounding business process re-engineering.&amp;nbsp; For example if the client says, &quot;we want radical
    redesign starting from a “clean sheet&quot; be sure you probe more to understand exactly what they mean.&amp;nbsp; Do they mean
    to change the boundaries of the process (e.g., question whether work should be performed in-house or outsourced, if
    work is to be moved to suppliers or customers) or are they just talking about a fresh approach to the processes within
    the existing boundaries?&amp;nbsp; Most clients cannot afford to completely throw away existing legacy systems and
    supporting processes.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
    Be aware that clients may have their own preferred definitions of terms and preferred approaches to various activities.
    An understanding of their industry and business is invaluable, e.g., being familiar with business terms and acronyms in
    common use.&amp;nbsp; Speak in terms they understand and that have the same meaning to all involved in the
    engagement.&amp;nbsp; Many times a client will confuse departments and organization with processes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />
    Choose approaches to activities that are comfortable for and acceptable to your client. Recognize that some may feel
    their jobs are threatened by process redesign efforts.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; And remember these words of caution.
&lt;/p>&lt;br dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot; />
&lt;br />
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        There is no single, correct definition of business process
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        There is no single, correct approach to defining business processes within a client organization
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>&lt;br />
&lt;br />
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
    Coming up with an optimal solution is one thing.&amp;nbsp; The real tough part is gaining the buy-in from the client to not
    only accept the change, but feel they own that change. The steps in creating and developing the Process Definition, if
    done correctly, elicits this buy-in and provides a strong communication vehicle to foster sharing of knowledge.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
    Be sure you have the best people to participate from the client organization in order to obtain accurate
    information.&amp;nbsp; Their peers should respect them, as they will be called upon as change agents as the project
    progresses.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
    &lt;strong>Tips on Getting Started&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
        Establish a process team responsible for the design and modeling of each process.&amp;nbsp; The team should have a
        proper combination of experienced users, decision makers, package solution architects, technology specialists, data
        and application architects, and business consultants.&amp;nbsp; Conceptual thinkers and those familiar with the
        client's business strategy and technology strategy as well as customer wants and needs, are key members of the team
        who will help drive towards innovative solutions.&amp;nbsp; Those who are deeply engrossed in the current operational
        processes sometimes find it difficult to think of different approaches, however they do provide a sounding board
        for ensuring the new process is practical.&amp;nbsp; The secret is to find the right balance.&amp;nbsp; Process owners
        responsible for the business or IT process in the client's organization should also be included.&amp;nbsp; For package
        implementations, a package solution architect from IBM should be assigned and team members should have the
        necessary knowledge of the package or technology enablers.&amp;nbsp;
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
        Team skills must include the ability to facilitate group sessions, manage potential conflict situations, listen and
        reflect back descriptions provided by process experts, envision processes from the details available in documents
        and facilitated sessions, and the use of tools to record modeling results.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
        If process modeling software is to be used, it should be identified, agreed upon and used through all phases of the
        project.&amp;nbsp; It should be compatible with the design and configuration tools associated with any package being
        implemented. The value of using a modeling tool increases as the project progresses into the design, configuration
        and implementation phases saving valuable project time.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    &lt;strong>Considerations in Process Modeling&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    There are several techniques used in the actual building of the process flow. The detail descriptions of the various
    techniques are described in Technique Papers, some of which are currently under development.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Spending half a day &quot;walking&quot; through processes in scope, preferably following the sequence of activities, saves a lot
    of time later, whereas it provides credibility during interviews and workshops as well.&amp;nbsp; However, do the minimum
    amount of process modeling of the “&lt;strong>current” environment&quot;&lt;/strong> only sufficient to achieve the objectives of
    the engagement and provide a baseline from which to measure improvements and change.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    For processes classified as Basic or Industry Standard, design should be driven by the selected package's reference
    processes or by standard functionality of the selected technology enablers.&amp;nbsp; This ensures that the design will
    exploit the best practices built in to many of today’s package applications. At the same time, capability and
    performance requirements need to be met.&amp;nbsp; A useful approach is to create a “&lt;strong>baseline&lt;/strong>” model,
    which is used as a starting point for process analysis.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The approach to designing the “&lt;strong>future&lt;/strong>” process will depend on the nature of the engagement.&amp;nbsp; In
    many cases, this will involve implementation and integration of technology.&amp;nbsp; The process model should define the
    automation and information components that are consistent with those defined in the application and architecture work
    products.
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    The Process Definition work product is used to define how a business operates or would like to operate. A Business
    Process is a series of related cross-functional Process Steps that takes an input, adds value to it, and produces an
    outcome. Business process definitions help describe activities and expected results and are used by businesses to
    improve their operations and performance. This Work Product may be used to define and describe current, baseline
    (possible), or future processes. It is developed on an iterative basis with increasing levels of detail from a high
    level to the activity/work step/IT level.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    This work product may be used with the process identification work product, which describes the &quot;static&quot; state of
    process definition, as opposed to the &quot;dynamic&quot; flow of process activities. The process identification work product
    would define &quot;what&quot; the processes are, and the Process Definition would show &quot;how&quot; the work is performed in terms of
    the flow of work. This Work Product is used in conjunction with process capability definition, process capability
    enabling definition and the future process/function attributes work products to define and capture the details about a
    process, its capabilities and its enablers.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Process Flows are an effective means of communicating how work is performed in a time-based, cross-functional
    representation of the &quot;business logic&quot;. It shows things such as responsibility or work, collaboration between
    performers, branches in the process flow, results of key decisions, synchronization points where wait states must be
    resolved for the process flow to continue, and related instances of work that are performed throughout the end to end
    process.

        The process gaps and proposed projects should be reviewed and verified by representatives from both the business
        and IT management, for completeness, feasibility and to gain commitment to go-ahead with the recommendations.&amp;nbsp;
        Changes in the business processes, particularly involving new technologies, usually mean a change in IT processes

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>
    The Enterprise Technology Framework is not static. Once an initial definition has been completed, it will continue to
    evolve over time and to further levels of detail, as both the business requirements and technology options change.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    To be effective, the Enterprise Technology Framework must reflect the business, application and data needs of the
    enterprise. In practice this means that key inputs will come from several detailed work products, including Strategic
    Directions, Capability Model, Process Enablers, Application Function Model, Data Stores and Data and Function Access
    and Placement.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    There is a considerable amount of intellectual capital, which exists in many of the ICM databases, to help with these
    activities. A major source is the IT Architecture and Design KN database and the e-Business KN databases:
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Review other architecture models and frameworks: Never start with a blank sheet of paper, when you are trying to define
    an Enterprise Technology Framework - there are many pre-defined technology models, frameworks and samples that have
    been produced in previous engagements for you to work from
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Pick one or two samples that reflect your client's organization, needs, etc. For example, the type of Enterprise
    Technology Framework that is needed for an organization in Mergers and Acquisition mode could be very different from
    one that has been outsourced. Providing a visual example of what you are trying to produce is very effective.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Each ABB should map to a definable collection of components, processes or functions.&amp;nbsp; Very often there may be
    common components across many ABBs - this would indicate good synergy and effective reuse of items to satisfy multiple
    business needs, for example, the use of common interfaces.&amp;nbsp; When this happens, consider defining these common
    components as a separate ABB.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The way the ABBs relate to each other is also significant.&amp;nbsp; Certain ABBs may require the use of functions provided
    by other ABBs in order to deliver their own function.&amp;nbsp; This is particularly true of systems management functions
    in a technical architecture. Consider that Security functions can be required and delivered within application,
    network, and operations and as separate a separate service.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Often different Architecture views may help convey a clearer message and focus activities. Supplying information on how
    to interpret and use the Enterprise Technology Framework may also help ensure successful interpretation and use of the
    information.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Remember, architecture modeling is an iterative task - the Enterprise Technology Framework will evolve over time as the
    content of each ABB is developed, defined and further more detailed work products are produced, as individual systems
    are designed and implemented and as component decisions are made.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Terminology warning: Note that in Enterprise Architecture work the word ‘component’ is sometimes used as a generic term
    for any element of an architecture, (in contrast to the more specific and precise meaning of component in ADS.)&amp;nbsp;
    See for example ‘Architecture Component’ in examples.
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    The &lt;b>Enterprise Technology Framework&lt;/b> work product is a key component part of an enterprise-wide business and IT
    architecture (normally referred to as an Enterprise Architecture). An Enterprise Technology Framework defines the
    technology services and functions (IT capabilities) required to support the business applications and data, including
    Common Application Services, Common Data Services, Common System Services, Network Services, Security Services,
    Platform Services, as well as the management tools used to support the delivery of IT service. The Enterprise
    Technology Framework must be totally aligned with the business applications and data, if the business goals, objectives
    and benefits are to be realized.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    This work product may be produced to varying levels of detail depending on the stage at which it is produced. This work
    product does &lt;u>not&lt;/u> represent a complete functional specification of the future IT requirements. Rather, it defines
    them at a sufficient level to allow alternate potential technologies and solution paths to be evaluated and investment
    decisions to be made prior to proceeding with the design and implementation of specific hardware and software
    components and application systems.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The Enterprise Technology Framework provides a conceptual model&amp;nbsp;which is defined at two levels:
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    &lt;strong>Conceptual model - basic level&lt;/strong> (produced to some level or another in most architecture or technology
    based engagements). This base Conceptual Model identifies and defines all the technology functions required by the
    enterprise and develops a single graphical representation at a high level, showing relationships and interdependencies.
    This model becomes a &quot;repository&quot; of information about technology across the enterprise. As this model is defined the
    work product:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Describes the IT functionality needed to support each of the desired IT services
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Documents the characteristics that the future IT environment(s) must have
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Documents the measurable performance targets (at an overall level) the future IT environment(s) must be able to
        support
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Rates the functionality requirements for each desired IT service in terms of their importance and contribution to
        achieving the desired strategic position
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Identifies candidate technologies that may be implemented, along with the feasibility of deploying those
        technologies and the potential impact they will have on the ability to deliver the required services
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    &lt;strong>Conceptual Model - Logical Functional level.&lt;/strong> At this Logical Functional level, instances of the
    technology functions defined in the base level are assembled into Logical Functional Environments that depict potential
    system boundaries based on sharing, usage and management rules. This level of the model purposely ignores the
    limitations imposed by technology and geography, leaving these to be addressed at the system design level when specific
    performance, availability and manageability design requirements will be addressed.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Various views of both levels of the Enterprise Technology Framework can be defined to show the technology services and
    functions required in support of various user groups, locations and business areas.

    This step is needed only at project start-up.&amp;nbsp; While the consultant's knowledge about the organization will surely

&lt;/p>

    If the engagement also includes assessment of the current organization, this work product can be completed at a more
    cursory level.&amp;nbsp; The consultant should learn enough from the current organization description to be able to agree
    with the client on what is to be included in the assessment and to set up the assessment activities and schedule.
&lt;/p>

    Although logical roles and organizational positions should be considered as different, it is inevitable that there will
    be cases where the two are identical.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    If the Business Structure work product has been produced, the &quot;Logical Locations&quot; identified will provide a starter
    list of locations and may suggest roles.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Roles, job titles, and organizational positions all may exist in many-to-many relationships to each other. Roles can be
    even more granular, such as &quot;opportunity noticer&quot; or &quot;call recorder&quot; - be aware of going to too low a level of detail
    at this stage. You will probably end up with between 10 - 40 roles depending on the scope of the engagement and the
    complexity of the enterprise.
&lt;/p>&lt;p/>&lt;p>
    Physical locations correspond very closely to the ‘location’ concept in the IBM Application Description Standard (ADS)
    for IT systems.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Although this work product defines logical locations, these will usually reflect some aspects of the organizational
    structure and the physical locations.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Various levels of validation are possible:

        walkthrough of the various organization charts
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        review and verification with client sponsor and executives
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    Business roles are logical, categories of jobs that perform the business activities of the enterprise, (e.g.
    Underwriter, Claims Assessor, Regulator, Loan Recipient, Sales Person). As such, they combine business activities into
    a recognizable relationship with the enterprise. Although these roles will very often appear to be the same as
    positions in the organizational structure, this is not the case and organizational positions will usually perform
    several business roles. Business Roles are strongly related to the functions and activities of the enterprise and are
    defined by the primary function/activity that they perform. So, for example, the &quot;Claims Assessor&quot; role is defined by
    the activity of assessing claims, even though individuals who perform that activity may perform other activities as
    well.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Business locations identify both the physical and logical places, or sites, where the activities of the business are
    carried out. The physical locations are simply the geographical places where the business has a presence; the logical
    locations are classifications, or categories, of these physical sites, based on the types of business activities that
    are performed at them. Examples of logical locations are Head Office, Satellite Branch, Warehouse, Claims Unit,
    Document Reception Center, etc.
&lt;/p>

    Having identified the Roles and Locations, the relationship between these and Business Activities is documented in the

        Definition and documentation of the business policies should begin as the measurements in the measurement model are&#xD;

        measurement data.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The Measurement Business Policy should not be confused with a data interface agreement.&amp;nbsp; A Measurement&#xD;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
    Make sure you understand the level of change the client is looking for.&amp;nbsp; There is a lot of confusion in
    terminology surrounding business process re-engineering.&amp;nbsp; For example if the client says, &quot;we want radical
    redesign starting from a “clean sheet&quot; be sure you probe more to understand exactly what they mean.&amp;nbsp; Do they mean
    to change the boundaries of the process (e.g., question whether work should be performed in-house or outsourced, if
    work is to be moved to suppliers or customers) or are they just talking about a fresh approach to the processes within
    the existing boundaries?&amp;nbsp; Most clients cannot afford to completely throw away existing legacy systems and
    supporting processes.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
    Be aware that clients may have their own preferred definitions of terms and preferred approaches to various activities.
    An understanding of their industry and business is invaluable, e.g., being familiar with business terms and acronyms in
    common use.&amp;nbsp; Speak in terms they understand and that have the same meaning to all involved in the
    engagement.&amp;nbsp; Many times a client will confuse departments and organization with processes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />
    Choose approaches to activities that are comfortable for and acceptable to your client. Recognize that some may feel
    their jobs are threatened by process redesign efforts.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; And remember these words of caution.
&lt;/p>&lt;br dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot; />
&lt;br />
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        There is no single, correct definition of business process
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        There is no single, correct approach to defining business processes within a client organization
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>&lt;br />
&lt;br />
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
    Coming up with an optimal solution is one thing.&amp;nbsp; The real tough part is gaining the buy-in from the client to not
    only accept the change, but feel they own that change. The steps in creating and developing the Process Definition, if
    done correctly, elicits this buy-in and provides a strong communication vehicle to foster sharing of knowledge.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
    Be sure you have the best people to participate from the client organization in order to obtain accurate
    information.&amp;nbsp; Their peers should respect them, as they will be called upon as change agents as the project
    progresses.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
    &lt;strong>Tips on Getting Started&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
        Establish a process team responsible for the design and modeling of each process.&amp;nbsp; The team should have a
        proper combination of experienced users, decision makers, package solution architects, technology specialists, data
        and application architects, and business consultants.&amp;nbsp; Conceptual thinkers and those familiar with the
        client's business strategy and technology strategy as well as customer wants and needs, are key members of the team
        who will help drive towards innovative solutions.&amp;nbsp; Those who are deeply engrossed in the current operational
        processes sometimes find it difficult to think of different approaches, however they do provide a sounding board
        for ensuring the new process is practical.&amp;nbsp; The secret is to find the right balance.&amp;nbsp; Process owners
        responsible for the business or IT process in the client's organization should also be included.&amp;nbsp; For package
        implementations, a package solution architect from IBM should be assigned and team members should have the
        necessary knowledge of the package or technology enablers.&amp;nbsp;
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
        Team skills must include the ability to facilitate group sessions, manage potential conflict situations, listen and
        reflect back descriptions provided by process experts, envision processes from the details available in documents
        and facilitated sessions, and the use of tools to record modeling results.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
        If process modeling software is to be used, it should be identified, agreed upon and used through all phases of the
        project.&amp;nbsp; It should be compatible with the design and configuration tools associated with any package being
        implemented. The value of using a modeling tool increases as the project progresses into the design, configuration
        and implementation phases saving valuable project time.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    &lt;strong>Considerations in Process Modeling&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    There are several techniques used in the actual building of the process flow. The detail descriptions of the various
    techniques are described in Technique Papers, some of which are currently under development.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Spending half a day &quot;walking&quot; through processes in scope, preferably following the sequence of activities, saves a lot
    of time later, whereas it provides credibility during interviews and workshops as well.&amp;nbsp; However, do the minimum
    amount of process modeling of the “&lt;strong>current” environment&quot;&lt;/strong> only sufficient to achieve the objectives of
    the engagement and provide a baseline from which to measure improvements and change.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    For processes classified as Basic or Industry Standard, design should be driven by the selected package's reference
    processes or by standard functionality of the selected technology enablers.&amp;nbsp; This ensures that the design will
    exploit the best practices built in to many of today’s package applications. At the same time, capability and
    performance requirements need to be met.&amp;nbsp; A useful approach is to create a “&lt;strong>baseline&lt;/strong>” model,
    which is used as a starting point for process analysis.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The approach to designing the “&lt;strong>future&lt;/strong>” process will depend on the nature of the engagement.&amp;nbsp; In
    many cases, this will involve implementation and integration of technology.&amp;nbsp; The process model should define the
    automation and information components that are consistent with those defined in the application and architecture work
    products.
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    The Process Definition work product is used to define how a business operates or would like to operate. A Business
    Process is a series of related cross-functional Process Steps that takes an input, adds value to it, and produces an
    outcome. Business process definitions help describe activities and expected results and are used by businesses to
    improve their operations and performance. This Work Product may be used to define and describe current, baseline
    (possible), or future processes. It is developed on an iterative basis with increasing levels of detail from a high
    level to the activity/work step/IT level.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    This work product may be used with the process identification work product, which describes the &quot;static&quot; state of
    process definition, as opposed to the &quot;dynamic&quot; flow of process activities. The process identification work product
    would define &quot;what&quot; the processes are, and the Process Definition would show &quot;how&quot; the work is performed in terms of
    the flow of work. This Work Product is used in conjunction with process capability definition, process capability
    enabling definition and the future process/function attributes work products to define and capture the details about a
    process, its capabilities and its enablers.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Process Flows are an effective means of communicating how work is performed in a time-based, cross-functional
    representation of the &quot;business logic&quot;. It shows things such as responsibility or work, collaboration between
    performers, branches in the process flow, results of key decisions, synchronization points where wait states must be
    resolved for the process flow to continue, and related instances of work that are performed throughout the end to end
    process.

        changes in the organization and in technology are considered together with the changes in process.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        The process gaps and proposed projects should be reviewed and verified by representatives from both the business
        and IT management, for completeness, feasibility and to gain commitment to go-ahead with the recommendations.&amp;nbsp;
        Changes in the business processes, particularly involving new technologies, usually mean a change in IT processes
        as well.

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>
    Having the right client participation is crucial to obtaining buy-in and thus the success of the entire effort. If you
    must delay the workshops to ensure the participation of the enterprise's thought leaders, then it is well worth it.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    After the initial workshops, both the principles and policies will undergo a widening circle of distribution. While
    this validation process must be tailored to individual client needs, it usually involves getting concurrence from all
    workshop participants, presentation to executives, and finally publication to the organization. A mechanism for
    updating the newly defined principles and/or policies should be devised as part of the overall management framework.
&lt;/p>&lt;p/>The definition of principles and policies should only be undertaken by suitable skilled practitioners, who have been
trained in one of the IBM Methods which specifically relates to this work product, for example, IT Strategy, Enterprise
Architecture, Security and IT Management - each of these disciplines has detailed guidance, technique papers and
samples/IC.</keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;b>Policy&lt;/b> - a high level statement of &lt;b>how&lt;/b> things will be managed or organized, including management goals,
objectives, beliefs and responsibilities. Policies are normally defined at an overall strategy level and can be related to
a specific area, for example, Security Policies, Management Policies. In many instances, policies reflect the law and
givens, which must be adhered to - this is especially true in the case of Security and Privacy policies. 
&lt;p>
    &lt;b>Principle&lt;/b> - defines the underlying general rules which an organization will use to utilize and deploy all
    business and IT resources and assets, across the enterprise e.g. &quot;IT systems will be designed to be capable of rapid
    expansion in line with unpredicted business growth.&quot;
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Principles should always include defined motivation and implication statements:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        The benefit statements highlight the value to the business of implementing the principle - and therefore provide a
        basis for justifying all related activities, for example, the implementation of an Enterprise Architecture, or the
        implementation of a Security Framework
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        The implication statements provide an outline of the key tasks, resources and potential costs to the business of
        implementing the principle. They also provide valuable inputs to future transition initiative and planning
        activities.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    Many different types and levels of Principles can be defined:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Guiding principles (normally 6 - 12) which provide an overall framework for decision making
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Business principles
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        IT principles (applications, data, technology, security, network, user interface, system management, development)
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Management and organizational principles
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Principles for mergers and acquisitions
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Principles for outsourcing
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    &lt;b>Guideline&lt;/b> - a general statement of direction, a desired future state which is not necessarily mandated.
    Guideline statements are similar in content to principle statements, but without the associated motivation and benefit
    statements.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    To be effective, all principles, policies and guidelines should be defined and agreed by both senior business and IT
    executives.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Once they have been agreed and published, the principles and policies provide a framework which can be used to explain
    and justify why certain business and IT decisions are being made, or need to be made.

        This work product needs to be developed as a joint client/consulting team exercise, usually in a workshop. It is
        vital that all parties understand the issues, contribute to the discussion, and support the agreed position.

        available in the IT Security ICAP Database.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        The documentation notation itself should conform to the established standards, e.g. accessibility.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    Standards provide the general “policy” level statements that are implementation-oriented and provide an auditable
    exception process. These sets of “rules” may make specific mention of technologies, methodologies, implementation
    procedures and other detail factors of the policy. A standard can be defined as something with a pre-described
    specification, that is measurable, recognized as having authoritative value, and which an organization chooses to
    implement as a basis for 'good practice'.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    These standards may have been determined by a previous study or may be de-facto or de-jure standards based on installed
    technology or management practices. The rationale, or source, of such determinations is documented for reference
    purposes. The work product also documents the implications of deviating from these standards. The deviation process
    itself will be documented as part of an overall management framework. Any significant components for which there are no
    established standards are also noted.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Standards can be developed from two viewpoints:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        From a corporate policy standpoint - in which case the standards will be enterprise-wide and technology independent
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        From an architectural standpoint - in which case the standards will be technology and product specific.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    Standards can be defined in many areas; the following ones are typical, dependent on the scope of a specific
    engagement:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Management standards
    &lt;/li>

    Where practical, create a measurements survey questionnaire based on the selected measurements from the measurement

    (1)The term “measurement” as used in this document reflects the sorts of entities that must be elicited when defining
    and developing the measurement program and system for an organization. Generally, the term “measurement” can refer to
    either a computed metric, which involves a calculation among primitive metrics, or a primitive metric that reflects a
    directly observable or countable event or data point. The terms are defined as follows:
&lt;/div>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Measurement: A logical group of metrics whose collected data has at least one dimension of observation that can be
        normalized and presented to provide a cross-organization view of performance. A measurement is also one of a
        logical collection called a measurement category and can have several computed metrics associated with it.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Computed Metric: An entity, generally of a calculable nature, reportable to a client, to the target organization’s
        management, or to both. Computed metrics are, by and large, derived from two or more primitive metrics by a
        mathematical calculation or algorithm.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Primitive Metric: Countable entities or distinct observable events that are manifest in the processes and/or
        behaviors occurring in the measuring organization. In any implementation, the sampling for primitive metric data
        should be from the closest available point of service for the process or behavior being measured.&lt;br />

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>
    When facilitating the process or capability assessment exercise, allow client team members to use a more granular
    rating scale (i.e. L+, H-, etc.).&amp;nbsp; This will also help achieve a consensus opinion on the rating of each
    assessment category and goal linkage.&amp;nbsp; In some e-strategy engagements the assessment may be as simple as
    identifying it as a strength or weakness and then providing some descriptions as to the weakness and potential
    corrective actions rather than even doing high level process flows.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    If the scope of a transformation project is driven by the client’s business strategies/goals and/or customer
    imperatives, output of the &quot;As-Is&quot; Process or Capability Assessment work product should directly support the process or

    The Enterprise Technology Framework is not static. Once an initial definition has been completed, it will continue to
    evolve over time and to further levels of detail, as both the business requirements and technology options change.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    To be effective, the Enterprise Technology Framework must reflect the business, application and data needs of the
    enterprise. In practice this means that key inputs will come from several detailed work products, including Strategic
    Directions, Capability Model, Process Enablers, Application Function Model, Data Stores and Data and Function Access
    and Placement.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    There is a considerable amount of intellectual capital, which exists in many of the ICM databases, to help with these
    activities. A major source is the IT Architecture and Design KN database and the e-Business KN databases:
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Review other architecture models and frameworks: Never start with a blank sheet of paper, when you are trying to define
    an Enterprise Technology Framework - there are many pre-defined technology models, frameworks and samples that have
    been produced in previous engagements for you to work from
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Pick one or two samples that reflect your client's organization, needs, etc. For example, the type of Enterprise
    Technology Framework that is needed for an organization in Mergers and Acquisition mode could be very different from
    one that has been outsourced. Providing a visual example of what you are trying to produce is very effective.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Each ABB should map to a definable collection of components, processes or functions.&amp;nbsp; Very often there may be
    common components across many ABBs - this would indicate good synergy and effective reuse of items to satisfy multiple
    business needs, for example, the use of common interfaces.&amp;nbsp; When this happens, consider defining these common
    components as a separate ABB.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The way the ABBs relate to each other is also significant.&amp;nbsp; Certain ABBs may require the use of functions provided
    by other ABBs in order to deliver their own function.&amp;nbsp; This is particularly true of systems management functions
    in a technical architecture. Consider that Security functions can be required and delivered within application,
    network, and operations and as separate a separate service.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Often different Architecture views may help convey a clearer message and focus activities. Supplying information on how
    to interpret and use the Enterprise Technology Framework may also help ensure successful interpretation and use of the
    information.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Remember, architecture modeling is an iterative task - the Enterprise Technology Framework will evolve over time as the
    content of each ABB is developed, defined and further more detailed work products are produced, as individual systems
    are designed and implemented and as component decisions are made.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Terminology warning: Note that in Enterprise Architecture work the word ‘component’ is sometimes used as a generic term
    for any element of an architecture, (in contrast to the more specific and precise meaning of component in ADS.)&amp;nbsp;
    See for example ‘Architecture Component’ in examples.
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    The &lt;b>Enterprise Technology Framework&lt;/b> work product is a key component part of an enterprise-wide business and IT
    architecture (normally referred to as an Enterprise Architecture). An Enterprise Technology Framework defines the
    technology services and functions (IT capabilities) required to support the business applications and data, including
    Common Application Services, Common Data Services, Common System Services, Network Services, Security Services,
    Platform Services, as well as the management tools used to support the delivery of IT service. The Enterprise
    Technology Framework must be totally aligned with the business applications and data, if the business goals, objectives
    and benefits are to be realized.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    This work product may be produced to varying levels of detail depending on the stage at which it is produced. This work
    product does &lt;u>not&lt;/u> represent a complete functional specification of the future IT requirements. Rather, it defines
    them at a sufficient level to allow alternate potential technologies and solution paths to be evaluated and investment
    decisions to be made prior to proceeding with the design and implementation of specific hardware and software
    components and application systems.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The Enterprise Technology Framework provides a conceptual model&amp;nbsp;which is defined at two levels:
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    &lt;strong>Conceptual model - basic level&lt;/strong> (produced to some level or another in most architecture or technology
    based engagements). This base Conceptual Model identifies and defines all the technology functions required by the
    enterprise and develops a single graphical representation at a high level, showing relationships and interdependencies.
    This model becomes a &quot;repository&quot; of information about technology across the enterprise. As this model is defined the
    work product:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Describes the IT functionality needed to support each of the desired IT services
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Documents the characteristics that the future IT environment(s) must have
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Documents the measurable performance targets (at an overall level) the future IT environment(s) must be able to
        support
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Rates the functionality requirements for each desired IT service in terms of their importance and contribution to
        achieving the desired strategic position
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Identifies candidate technologies that may be implemented, along with the feasibility of deploying those
        technologies and the potential impact they will have on the ability to deliver the required services
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    &lt;strong>Conceptual Model - Logical Functional level.&lt;/strong> At this Logical Functional level, instances of the
    technology functions defined in the base level are assembled into Logical Functional Environments that depict potential
    system boundaries based on sharing, usage and management rules. This level of the model purposely ignores the
    limitations imposed by technology and geography, leaving these to be addressed at the system design level when specific
    performance, availability and manageability design requirements will be addressed.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Various views of both levels of the Enterprise Technology Framework can be defined to show the technology services and
    functions required in support of various user groups, locations and business areas.

    &lt;strong>Key Points&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        If the scope of the project is driven by the client's business strategies/goals and/or customer imperatives, output
        of the Process Assessment work product should directly support the process selection with rationale such as process
        performance and process importance in achieving business goals and / or customer sat.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        In a transformation project do not waste time at this stage in developing current process models / maps to a
        detailed level (identification of sub-processes (level 2) is sufficient to do an assessment, whereas level 3 (or 4)
        is required for analysis)
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        It is useful to get different views of importance / performance if you can, e.g. customers, suppliers, business
        partners, employees, etc.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Select the appropriate assessments based on client objectives / nature of the engagement, don't try and do them
        all!
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        The better you can prepare before the workshop, the more productive each workshop will be.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Use subject matter experts to minimize lost time and credibility.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Use the simple tools and techniques to help identify root causes; brainstorming, cause and effect (fishbone)
        diagrams, scatter diagrams, Pareto Analysis.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    &lt;strong>Approaches to business process redesign vary greatly. IBM’s business process design approach includes the
    following principles:&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Best Practices&lt;/strong> is the task of providing measurement and comparison to best industry practices to
        ensure that operations remain cost efficient. Benchmarking may also involve the examination of similar processes

        &lt;strong>Operations assessment&lt;/strong> is a methodical process of analyzing how employee skill sets, business
        processes, and existing information systems function. The result is a comprehensive assessment of how effectively a
        company uses resources and how well its operating units perform.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Customer Alignment&lt;/strong> assesses the value of business activities as they pertain to customers to
        ensure that an organization is closely aligned with its customers’ specific needs.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>End-To-End Solutions&lt;/strong> analyze an entire process to discover more effective and efficient ways of
        handling it. Examine business processes across all functional and organizational boundaries (including customers,
        suppliers, and business partners) to provide a holistic view and maximum flexibility in optimizing the process.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Eliminate Non-Value Added Activities&lt;/strong> by identifying and eliminating any activities that do not
        provide value to either internal or external customers.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Time Compression&lt;/strong> reduce process time and overlap activities whenever possible. Speeding up
        business cycles can reduce costs and increase customer satisfaction that translates into increased revenue.
    &lt;/li>

        In a large project where multiple teams are working on different processes it is important to verify the detail and

    When it comes to the assessment of the current application portfolio, there are various approaches that can be
    used:&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Some more sophisticated approaches to current portfolio analysis categorize the applications according to their
        importance and contribution to the business, These ideas, developed by McFarlan (1984) and extended by Ward and
        Griffiths (1996), make use of a 2x2 matrix to classify each application. The value of this approach lies in its
        simplicity (it is easy to get client staff to classify the applications into one of 4 categories) and the fact that
        it provides a high-level picture of the complete current portfolio that can be agreed by the different groups of
        stakeholders.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Combine the application and database questions. In older legacy environments that were developed without any view
        on sharing data through corporate databases - the two will be inextricably linked.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact&amp;nbsp;can take many forms: an assessment of the functional and technical quality of a client's installed&#xD;
    applications, databases and/or infrastructure.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    With respect to the applications, the assessment is focused on two complimentary views of functional and technical&#xD;
    quality (FQ / TQ as it is sometimes called). The former is concerned with both the extent to which the applications&#xD;
    support the critical business functions and the quality of that support. The latter is concerned with their technical&#xD;
    efficiency, (e.g. their age, stability, accessibility, reliability, maintainability) and the longer term technical&#xD;
    potential.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For database assessment, this work product is focused on data quality, (i.e. currency, redundancy, accuracy) and the&#xD;
    potential to support the future business strategies.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    With respect to the current infrastructure, the assessment is focused on technical efficiency, e.g. stability,&#xD;
    reliability, maintainability, age of installed base, support for critical business functions e.g. availability,&#xD;
    performance, accessibility, anticipated business growth and the longer term technical potential.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The scope of this type of assessment is usually limited to a subset of the application / database portfolio that is&#xD;
    judged to be the most important in terms of their support for the current business operations and their future&#xD;
    potential.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Any specific problems and opportunities associated with these applications, databases and infrastructure are captured&#xD;
    and documented as input to subsequent activities and work products&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An assessment of the efficiency, cost structure or competencies of the IS/IT organization and its management. This&#xD;
    often takes the form of general industry and peer group comparisons, using Industry standard models, IBM IT Comparison&#xD;
    Intellectual Capital and other external sources of material e.g. Gartner Group. Comparisons can be done in a number of&#xD;
    different areas:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        IT as a % of overall expenses, IT as a % of revenue&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Data Centre computing - utilized MIPS (or equivalent)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Departmental and personal computing - numbers of users&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Information capture and presentation - as a % of total IT costs&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Data Network - numbers of end-user stations supported&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Voice Network - numbers of end-user connections supported&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Application development and maintenance - as a % of total IT costs&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Help Desk - total calls per year handled&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Current IT department staffing and skills&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An assessment of the IS/IT organization’s capabilities, including:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The efficiency and effectiveness of current processes, policies, practices and management culture&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Whether the organization is structured and aligned effectively to support the business - including the required&#xD;
        linkages between departments&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Skills, resourcing policies&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Effectiveness of planning and implementation roll-out&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Assessments of this type can be conducted in several types of engagements:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        As part of a strategy level engagement - when it is normally the only assessment of IT that is undertaken&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        During the early stages of an Enterprise Architecture level engagement, to gain an insight into the overall age,&#xD;
        usage and gaps in the applications, data and infrastructure as an input to defining the requirements that are&#xD;
        captured in the EA model&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        During a detailed IT Infrastructure Management or Networking engagement&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        As part of an As-Is versus To-Be comparison to support migration from legacy to new systems. This migration often&#xD;
        occurs to take advantage of new technology and to support a new user group including people who require special&#xD;
        accessibility enablers.&#xD;

        Business policies should be pragmatic and easily understood.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>
    Having the right client participation is crucial to obtaining buy-in and thus the success of the entire effort. If you
    must delay the workshops to ensure the participation of the enterprise's thought leaders, then it is well worth it.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    After the initial workshops, both the principles and policies will undergo a widening circle of distribution. While
    this validation process must be tailored to individual client needs, it usually involves getting concurrence from all
    workshop participants, presentation to executives, and finally publication to the organization. A mechanism for
    updating the newly defined principles and/or policies should be devised as part of the overall management framework.
&lt;/p>&lt;p/>The definition of principles and policies should only be undertaken by suitable skilled practitioners, who have been
trained in one of the IBM Methods which specifically relates to this work product, for example, IT Strategy, Enterprise
Architecture, Security and IT Management - each of these disciplines has detailed guidance, technique papers and
samples/IC.</keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;b>Policy&lt;/b> - a high level statement of &lt;b>how&lt;/b> things will be managed or organized, including management goals,
objectives, beliefs and responsibilities. Policies are normally defined at an overall strategy level and can be related to
a specific area, for example, Security Policies, Management Policies. In many instances, policies reflect the law and
givens, which must be adhered to - this is especially true in the case of Security and Privacy policies. 
&lt;p>
    &lt;b>Principle&lt;/b> - defines the underlying general rules which an organization will use to utilize and deploy all
    business and IT resources and assets, across the enterprise e.g. &quot;IT systems will be designed to be capable of rapid
    expansion in line with unpredicted business growth.&quot;
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Principles should always include defined motivation and implication statements:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        The benefit statements highlight the value to the business of implementing the principle - and therefore provide a
        basis for justifying all related activities, for example, the implementation of an Enterprise Architecture, or the
        implementation of a Security Framework
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        The implication statements provide an outline of the key tasks, resources and potential costs to the business of
        implementing the principle. They also provide valuable inputs to future transition initiative and planning
        activities.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

    Many different types and levels of Principles can be defined:

&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Guiding principles (normally 6 - 12) which provide an overall framework for decision making
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Business principles
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        IT principles (applications, data, technology, security, network, user interface, system management, development)
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Management and organizational principles
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Principles for mergers and acquisitions
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Principles for outsourcing
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    &lt;b>Guideline&lt;/b> - a general statement of direction, a desired future state which is not necessarily mandated.
    Guideline statements are similar in content to principle statements, but without the associated motivation and benefit
    statements.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    To be effective, all principles, policies and guidelines should be defined and agreed by both senior business and IT
    executives.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Once they have been agreed and published, the principles and policies provide a framework which can be used to explain
    and justify why certain business and IT decisions are being made, or need to be made.

        This work product needs to be developed as a joint client/consulting team exercise, usually in a workshop. It is
        vital that all parties understand the issues, contribute to the discussion, and support the agreed position.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Accessibility standards should only be developed by someone knowledgeable and skilled in accessibility.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Security standards should only be developed by Methodology-trained Security professionals. Additional resources
        available in the IT Security ICAP Database.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        The documentation notation itself should conform to the established standards, e.g. accessibility.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    Standards provide the general “policy” level statements that are implementation-oriented and provide an auditable
    exception process. These sets of “rules” may make specific mention of technologies, methodologies, implementation
    procedures and other detail factors of the policy. A standard can be defined as something with a pre-described
    specification, that is measurable, recognized as having authoritative value, and which an organization chooses to
    implement as a basis for 'good practice'.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    These standards may have been determined by a previous study or may be de-facto or de-jure standards based on installed
    technology or management practices. The rationale, or source, of such determinations is documented for reference
    purposes. The work product also documents the implications of deviating from these standards. The deviation process
    itself will be documented as part of an overall management framework. Any significant components for which there are no
    established standards are also noted.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Standards can be developed from two viewpoints:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        From a corporate policy standpoint - in which case the standards will be enterprise-wide and technology independent
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        From an architectural standpoint - in which case the standards will be technology and product specific.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    Standards can be defined in many areas; the following ones are typical, dependent on the scope of a specific
    engagement:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Management standards
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Technology standards
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Application development standards
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Security standards
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Accessibility standards
    &lt;/li>

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>
    When facilitating the process or capability assessment exercise, allow client team members to use a more granular
    rating scale (i.e. L+, H-, etc.).&amp;nbsp; This will also help achieve a consensus opinion on the rating of each
    assessment category and goal linkage.&amp;nbsp; In some e-strategy engagements the assessment may be as simple as
    identifying it as a strength or weakness and then providing some descriptions as to the weakness and potential
    corrective actions rather than even doing high level process flows.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    If the scope of a transformation project is driven by the client’s business strategies/goals and/or customer
    imperatives, output of the &quot;As-Is&quot; Process or Capability Assessment work product should directly support the process or
    capability selection with rationale such as process or capability performance and process capability linkage to goals
    or value propositions /outcomes.&lt;br />

    &lt;strong>Key Points&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        If the scope of the project is driven by the client's business strategies/goals and/or customer imperatives, output
        of the Process Assessment work product should directly support the process selection with rationale such as process
        performance and process importance in achieving business goals and / or customer sat.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        In a transformation project do not waste time at this stage in developing current process models / maps to a
        detailed level (identification of sub-processes (level 2) is sufficient to do an assessment, whereas level 3 (or 4)
        is required for analysis)
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        It is useful to get different views of importance / performance if you can, e.g. customers, suppliers, business
        partners, employees, etc.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Select the appropriate assessments based on client objectives / nature of the engagement, don't try and do them
        all!
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        The better you can prepare before the workshop, the more productive each workshop will be.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Use subject matter experts to minimize lost time and credibility.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Use the simple tools and techniques to help identify root causes; brainstorming, cause and effect (fishbone)
        diagrams, scatter diagrams, Pareto Analysis.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    &lt;strong>Approaches to business process redesign vary greatly. IBM’s business process design approach includes the
    following principles:&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Best Practices&lt;/strong> is the task of providing measurement and comparison to best industry practices to
        ensure that operations remain cost efficient. Benchmarking may also involve the examination of similar processes
        outside the industry in which the organization currently competes.&amp;nbsp;
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Operations assessment&lt;/strong> is a methodical process of analyzing how employee skill sets, business
        processes, and existing information systems function. The result is a comprehensive assessment of how effectively a
        company uses resources and how well its operating units perform.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Customer Alignment&lt;/strong> assesses the value of business activities as they pertain to customers to
        ensure that an organization is closely aligned with its customers’ specific needs.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>End-To-End Solutions&lt;/strong> analyze an entire process to discover more effective and efficient ways of
        handling it. Examine business processes across all functional and organizational boundaries (including customers,
        suppliers, and business partners) to provide a holistic view and maximum flexibility in optimizing the process.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Eliminate Non-Value Added Activities&lt;/strong> by identifying and eliminating any activities that do not
        provide value to either internal or external customers.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Time Compression&lt;/strong> reduce process time and overlap activities whenever possible. Speeding up
        business cycles can reduce costs and increase customer satisfaction that translates into increased revenue.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Organize Around Outcomes&lt;/strong> organize and measure people and processes around goals and outcomes not
        as series of intermediate steps.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    The appropriate process assessment/analysis should be selected based on the nature of the engagement. These include:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Importance (ranking) / performance (rating) assessment
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        The process capabilities are best defined and documented in workshop environments where the project team and the
        client subject matter experts can develop the documentation together.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        In a large project where multiple teams are working on different processes it is important to verify the detail and
        level of the documentation for consistency.&amp;nbsp; Since multiple people will be creating and writing the files,
        there is always a very high potential for the information to be documented at various levels of detail.&amp;nbsp; An
        example of a completed template should be provided, as well as, a quality check performed after each team member
        has completed one or two.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        The process capability requirements should be held and maintained centrally.&amp;nbsp; Individual project team members
        will be responsible for updating the work products allocated to themselves or to their team.&amp;nbsp; All team members
        should have display access to the full set.&amp;nbsp; This will help everyone to be informed about proposals made by
        other teams, especially regarding integration issues.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Implement change and version control of Process Capability Definition documents.&lt;br />
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    The Process Capabilities may be identified at the process group, process, sub-process or activity level and address
    process design points (major process elements) and process capabilities.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The Process Capabilities Definition Work Product:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Identifies and describes, with text and graphics, the design points of the process and its sub-processes

        Identifies and describes, with text and graphics, the required capabilities of the process and its -sub-processes
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Identifies and describes the linkage to the strategic capabilities
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    The Process Capabilities represents those critical things that a business process must be able to do to ensure that the
    supported Strategic Capabilities can be enabled. Process Capabilities provides different strength of impact, i.e. High,
    Medium or Low, to the supported Strategic Capabilities.

    Modeling business processes has no value in itself.&amp;nbsp; It provides the basis for understanding and analysis that can
    help clients identify opportunities to improve performance and operational effectiveness whether it’s through
    continuous improvement, re-engineering, repairing broken processes or transforming the business. The aim should be to
    help the client develop a process which:
&lt;/p>

        Is responsive to executive goals
    &lt;/li>

        Integrates organization learning
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
    Make sure you understand the level of change the client is looking for.&amp;nbsp; There is a lot of confusion in
    terminology surrounding business process re-engineering.&amp;nbsp; For example if the client says, &quot;we want radical
    redesign starting from a “clean sheet&quot; be sure you probe more to understand exactly what they mean.&amp;nbsp; Do they mean
    to change the boundaries of the process (e.g., question whether work should be performed in-house or outsourced, if
    work is to be moved to suppliers or customers) or are they just talking about a fresh approach to the processes within
    the existing boundaries?&amp;nbsp; Most clients cannot afford to completely throw away existing legacy systems and
    supporting processes.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
    Be aware that clients may have their own preferred definitions of terms and preferred approaches to various activities.
    An understanding of their industry and business is invaluable, e.g., being familiar with business terms and acronyms in
    common use.&amp;nbsp; Speak in terms they understand and that have the same meaning to all involved in the
    engagement.&amp;nbsp; Many times a client will confuse departments and organization with processes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />
    Choose approaches to activities that are comfortable for and acceptable to your client. Recognize that some may feel
    their jobs are threatened by process redesign efforts.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; And remember these words of caution.
&lt;/p>&lt;br dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot; />
&lt;br />
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        There is no single, correct definition of business process
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        There is no single, correct approach to defining business processes within a client organization
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>&lt;br />
&lt;br />
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
    Coming up with an optimal solution is one thing.&amp;nbsp; The real tough part is gaining the buy-in from the client to not
    only accept the change, but feel they own that change. The steps in creating and developing the Process Definition, if
    done correctly, elicits this buy-in and provides a strong communication vehicle to foster sharing of knowledge.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
    Be sure you have the best people to participate from the client organization in order to obtain accurate
    information.&amp;nbsp; Their peers should respect them, as they will be called upon as change agents as the project
    progresses.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
    &lt;strong>Tips on Getting Started&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
        Establish a process team responsible for the design and modeling of each process.&amp;nbsp; The team should have a
        proper combination of experienced users, decision makers, package solution architects, technology specialists, data
        and application architects, and business consultants.&amp;nbsp; Conceptual thinkers and those familiar with the
        client's business strategy and technology strategy as well as customer wants and needs, are key members of the team
        who will help drive towards innovative solutions.&amp;nbsp; Those who are deeply engrossed in the current operational
        processes sometimes find it difficult to think of different approaches, however they do provide a sounding board
        for ensuring the new process is practical.&amp;nbsp; The secret is to find the right balance.&amp;nbsp; Process owners
        responsible for the business or IT process in the client's organization should also be included.&amp;nbsp; For package
        implementations, a package solution architect from IBM should be assigned and team members should have the
        necessary knowledge of the package or technology enablers.&amp;nbsp;
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
        Team skills must include the ability to facilitate group sessions, manage potential conflict situations, listen and
        reflect back descriptions provided by process experts, envision processes from the details available in documents
        and facilitated sessions, and the use of tools to record modeling results.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
        If process modeling software is to be used, it should be identified, agreed upon and used through all phases of the
        project.&amp;nbsp; It should be compatible with the design and configuration tools associated with any package being
        implemented. The value of using a modeling tool increases as the project progresses into the design, configuration
        and implementation phases saving valuable project time.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    &lt;strong>Considerations in Process Modeling&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    There are several techniques used in the actual building of the process flow. The detail descriptions of the various
    techniques are described in Technique Papers, some of which are currently under development.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Spending half a day &quot;walking&quot; through processes in scope, preferably following the sequence of activities, saves a lot
    of time later, whereas it provides credibility during interviews and workshops as well.&amp;nbsp; However, do the minimum
    amount of process modeling of the “&lt;strong>current” environment&quot;&lt;/strong> only sufficient to achieve the objectives of
    the engagement and provide a baseline from which to measure improvements and change.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    For processes classified as Basic or Industry Standard, design should be driven by the selected package's reference
    processes or by standard functionality of the selected technology enablers.&amp;nbsp; This ensures that the design will
    exploit the best practices built in to many of today’s package applications. At the same time, capability and
    performance requirements need to be met.&amp;nbsp; A useful approach is to create a “&lt;strong>baseline&lt;/strong>” model,
    which is used as a starting point for process analysis.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The approach to designing the “&lt;strong>future&lt;/strong>” process will depend on the nature of the engagement.&amp;nbsp; In
    many cases, this will involve implementation and integration of technology.&amp;nbsp; The process model should define the
    automation and information components that are consistent with those defined in the application and architecture work
    products.
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    The Process Definition work product is used to define how a business operates or would like to operate. A Business
    Process is a series of related cross-functional Process Steps that takes an input, adds value to it, and produces an
    outcome. Business process definitions help describe activities and expected results and are used by businesses to
    improve their operations and performance. This Work Product may be used to define and describe current, baseline
    (possible), or future processes. It is developed on an iterative basis with increasing levels of detail from a high
    level to the activity/work step/IT level.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    This work product may be used with the process identification work product, which describes the &quot;static&quot; state of
    process definition, as opposed to the &quot;dynamic&quot; flow of process activities. The process identification work product
    would define &quot;what&quot; the processes are, and the Process Definition would show &quot;how&quot; the work is performed in terms of
    the flow of work. This Work Product is used in conjunction with process capability definition, process capability
    enabling definition and the future process/function attributes work products to define and capture the details about a
    process, its capabilities and its enablers.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Process Flows are an effective means of communicating how work is performed in a time-based, cross-functional
    representation of the &quot;business logic&quot;. It shows things such as responsibility or work, collaboration between
    performers, branches in the process flow, results of key decisions, synchronization points where wait states must be
    resolved for the process flow to continue, and related instances of work that are performed throughout the end to end
    process.

    The Measurement Gap Analysis work product identifies new processes or changes to existing processes that should be
    instituted to support such measurement data collection, analysis, and use. Furthermore, it proposes changes to the
    organization or its supporting processes so that it can support the collection, analysis, and use of the selected
    measurements.
&lt;/p>

    The Measurement Gap Analysis work product articulates the difference between the instance of the measurement model and
    the customer’s current measurements. It provides recommended refinements to the following:

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>
    The Enterprise Technology Framework is not static. Once an initial definition has been completed, it will continue to
    evolve over time and to further levels of detail, as both the business requirements and technology options change.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    To be effective, the Enterprise Technology Framework must reflect the business, application and data needs of the
    enterprise. In practice this means that key inputs will come from several detailed work products, including Strategic
    Directions, Capability Model, Process Enablers, Application Function Model, Data Stores and Data and Function Access
    and Placement.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    There is a considerable amount of intellectual capital, which exists in many of the ICM databases, to help with these
    activities. A major source is the IT Architecture and Design KN database and the e-Business KN databases:
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Review other architecture models and frameworks: Never start with a blank sheet of paper, when you are trying to define
    an Enterprise Technology Framework - there are many pre-defined technology models, frameworks and samples that have
    been produced in previous engagements for you to work from
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Pick one or two samples that reflect your client's organization, needs, etc. For example, the type of Enterprise
    Technology Framework that is needed for an organization in Mergers and Acquisition mode could be very different from
    one that has been outsourced. Providing a visual example of what you are trying to produce is very effective.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Each ABB should map to a definable collection of components, processes or functions.&amp;nbsp; Very often there may be
    common components across many ABBs - this would indicate good synergy and effective reuse of items to satisfy multiple
    business needs, for example, the use of common interfaces.&amp;nbsp; When this happens, consider defining these common
    components as a separate ABB.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The way the ABBs relate to each other is also significant.&amp;nbsp; Certain ABBs may require the use of functions provided
    by other ABBs in order to deliver their own function.&amp;nbsp; This is particularly true of systems management functions
    in a technical architecture. Consider that Security functions can be required and delivered within application,
    network, and operations and as separate a separate service.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Often different Architecture views may help convey a clearer message and focus activities. Supplying information on how
    to interpret and use the Enterprise Technology Framework may also help ensure successful interpretation and use of the
    information.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Remember, architecture modeling is an iterative task - the Enterprise Technology Framework will evolve over time as the
    content of each ABB is developed, defined and further more detailed work products are produced, as individual systems
    are designed and implemented and as component decisions are made.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Terminology warning: Note that in Enterprise Architecture work the word ‘component’ is sometimes used as a generic term
    for any element of an architecture, (in contrast to the more specific and precise meaning of component in ADS.)&amp;nbsp;
    See for example ‘Architecture Component’ in examples.
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    The &lt;b>Enterprise Technology Framework&lt;/b> work product is a key component part of an enterprise-wide business and IT
    architecture (normally referred to as an Enterprise Architecture). An Enterprise Technology Framework defines the
    technology services and functions (IT capabilities) required to support the business applications and data, including
    Common Application Services, Common Data Services, Common System Services, Network Services, Security Services,
    Platform Services, as well as the management tools used to support the delivery of IT service. The Enterprise
    Technology Framework must be totally aligned with the business applications and data, if the business goals, objectives
    and benefits are to be realized.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    This work product may be produced to varying levels of detail depending on the stage at which it is produced. This work
    product does &lt;u>not&lt;/u> represent a complete functional specification of the future IT requirements. Rather, it defines
    them at a sufficient level to allow alternate potential technologies and solution paths to be evaluated and investment
    decisions to be made prior to proceeding with the design and implementation of specific hardware and software
    components and application systems.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The Enterprise Technology Framework provides a conceptual model&amp;nbsp;which is defined at two levels:
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    &lt;strong>Conceptual model - basic level&lt;/strong> (produced to some level or another in most architecture or technology
    based engagements). This base Conceptual Model identifies and defines all the technology functions required by the
    enterprise and develops a single graphical representation at a high level, showing relationships and interdependencies.
    This model becomes a &quot;repository&quot; of information about technology across the enterprise. As this model is defined the
    work product:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Describes the IT functionality needed to support each of the desired IT services
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Documents the characteristics that the future IT environment(s) must have
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Documents the measurable performance targets (at an overall level) the future IT environment(s) must be able to
        support
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Rates the functionality requirements for each desired IT service in terms of their importance and contribution to
        achieving the desired strategic position
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Identifies candidate technologies that may be implemented, along with the feasibility of deploying those
        technologies and the potential impact they will have on the ability to deliver the required services
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    &lt;strong>Conceptual Model - Logical Functional level.&lt;/strong> At this Logical Functional level, instances of the
    technology functions defined in the base level are assembled into Logical Functional Environments that depict potential
    system boundaries based on sharing, usage and management rules. This level of the model purposely ignores the
    limitations imposed by technology and geography, leaving these to be addressed at the system design level when specific
    performance, availability and manageability design requirements will be addressed.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Various views of both levels of the Enterprise Technology Framework can be defined to show the technology services and
    functions required in support of various user groups, locations and business areas.

    Performance appraisals and bonuses are sensitive issues. Therefore, anticipate resistance and be vigilant about reward
    systems that may run counter to your aims.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    It may be necessary to dismantle measures that encourage local optimization at the expense of the rest of the
    organization.&lt;br />
    Involve middle managers and supervisors early in the process and seek their buy-in. Begin by actively listening to
    their concerns and addressing the ones you can as quickly as possible before you ask for their support.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    In many redesigns it will become less possible and less necessary to hold individuals specifically accountable for
    overall outcomes. The greatest gains will often come from interdependence and teamwork.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    An effective Performance Management process is regularly scheduled and timely, and it is developmental. It reinforces
    superior performance and recognizes the achievement of goals. It corrects inferior performance and establishes
    performance improvements, and it ensures appropriate levels of training.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    With measures, some of the indicators will be very soft, while many will not be sourced from existing systems. Some
    data may come from external sources. Measures should be linked to SMART objectives, and goals should cascade down the
    organization. A good measure:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;div>
            Is accepted as being meaningful to the customer

    The final test of success will be if the systems accomplish the client organization's goals and are accepted by
    employees. The best way to ensure this is to involve employees as much as possible from the start and to ensure that
    the results and reactions to the implementation of new performance management, measures, and rewards systems are
    monitored and the results fed back to amending the system if necessary.

    Experience shows that it is important to get this scope right and to get it in focus at an early stage in the project
    while the other domains of redesign (process and IT) are also evolving. This allows the integration of redesign and
    implementation activities into the overall transition plan.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Most transformation projects require, as a minimum, the redesign of:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;div>
            Key job roles and responsibilities (in terms of activities, behaviors, and measurements) particularly those of
            process owners and key users
        &lt;/div>
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;div>
            Cross-functional working patterns, team working, etc.
        &lt;/div>
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;div>
            The performance management system that motivates the new behaviors
        &lt;/div>
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>&lt;p/>&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
    IBM and the client need to be very clear on what redesign will entail--the scope, the direction, and the risk. Anything
    that has been eliminated from the scope should be explicitly documented. If the client wants to carry out some redesign
    activities internally, this is the time to set clear expectations and devise an issue management approach to avoid
    resource conflicts. For multi-site or -function projects, there may be a need to conduct multiple reviews to gain
    agreement at the local level as well as the project level.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
    Review the analysis and recommendations with the client and probe for concerns, objections, and signs of resistance or
    faltering commitment. Test for their understanding of the possible implications of redesign. Ensure that you have their
    agreement to both scope and requirements before proceeding with redesign.

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        When documenting these requirements, ensure that the needs of all stakeholders are represented.&amp;nbsp; In&#xD;
        particular, don't forget to include the needs of those responsible for maintaining or supporting the system once&#xD;
        delivered.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        There are typically some overlaps and &quot;gray areas&quot; between these requirements and other requirements work&#xD;
        products.&amp;nbsp; For example, the authorization behavior of a system can be specified as use cases, or as statements&#xD;
        within system-wide requirements.&amp;nbsp; The overall driving need is that no important requirements are missed or&#xD;
        duplicated and that there is an agreed approach for capturing and processing every type of requirement.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Requirements originate from many places. Documenting the source of the requirement is particularly important when&#xD;
        separating out externally mandated requirements.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Requirements are often thought of as &quot;Qualitative&quot; (specifying a quality or desirable characteristic) versus&#xD;
        &quot;Quantitative&quot; (specifying a quantity).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Qualitative requirements can sometimes be elaborated into&#xD;
        quantitative requirements.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A good quality requirement is one that can be verified, either through testing or some other objective evaluation.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        These&amp;nbsp;requirements should be evaluated for cost, schedule impact and level of contribution to business goals.&#xD;
        They should be iteratively challenged, defended and amended based on this evaluation.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        While gathering and validating non-functional requirements, maintain Assumptions and Issues lists. &#xD;
        &lt;p>&#xD;
            Some activities will not give you satisfactory answers. This can be due to lack of information, or simply&#xD;
            because you consider the answer threatens the viability of the design. Therefore, create two lists, and&#xD;
            maintain them through the design study:&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Any assumptions you make during the requirements and design process, including the rationale or thought&#xD;
                processes behind those assumptions. Assumptions may be used to identify related subprojects or items of&#xD;
                work, which are outside the scope of or after this project.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Any major issues (significant concerns that could become show-stoppers).&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;

&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        The issues should be reviewed with the sponsor at the end of each phase. The assumptions need to be reviewed also,&#xD;
        at the end of each phase, but the sponsor might not always be the correct person for the less important ones.&#xD;
        Assumptions and issues apply to all work products, but are particularly common for non-functional requirements.&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;ul dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;

    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Requirements of a system are typically classified as functional and non-functional requirements respectively.&#xD;
    Non-functional requirements specify constraints and quality attributes that a system must meet along with its&#xD;
    functional requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There is no universally accepted way of classifying a non-functional requirement from a functional one. However it is&#xD;
    widely accepted that functional requirements specify “what” the system must do, whereas non-functional requirements&#xD;
    specify restrictions, constraints or quality attribute values that the system must comply (or operate within) whilst&#xD;
    meeting its “functional requirements”. Thus concerns about performance, availability, and other measurable system&#xD;
    qualities are considered as non-functional requirements. However concerns about security, auditability, regulatory&#xD;
    compliance, etc, can be traced to one or more functional requirements of the system, hence are regarded as functional&#xD;
    requirements by some whereas non-functional requirements by others.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The method adopts a working definition of NFRs as being any quality attribute, constraint and other “cross cutting”&#xD;
    aspect of a system, which by itself is not a core function of the system, but qualifies how the system meets/delivers&#xD;
    its core functions. In contrast the set of core functions of a system is considered as a functional requirement.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Finally NFRs as described by this artifact treat the “system” as a “black box” and apply to external qualities of the&#xD;
    “system” rather than internal system design. Often performance qualities are specified for internal system components&#xD;
    by indicating performance “budgets” and which are treated as NFRs. However such activity is viewed as creation of a&#xD;
    “Performance View” or “Performance Model” of the “System” using NFRs as inputs, rather than being NFRs.&#xD;

    A major dependency exists on the development of the Process Identification and Process Definition model prior to

        Business policies should be pragmatic and easily understood.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;

    This step is needed only at project start-up.&amp;nbsp; While the consultant's knowledge about the organization will surely
    continue to grow as other work products are completed, this particular work product is unlikely to undergo another
    iteration later in the project.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    If the engagement also includes assessment of the current organization, this work product can be completed at a more
    cursory level.&amp;nbsp; The consultant should learn enough from the current organization description to be able to agree
    with the client on what is to be included in the assessment and to set up the assessment activities and schedule.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Alternatively, if the engagement does not include an assessment, the consultant should aim for a thorough description,
    which remains factual and does not extend into evaluative judgments.

    Ensure that design points act as guidelines for designing the organization.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Do not expect to fulfill all the design points--seek compromises on the most critical areas. Be prepared to be flexible
    in how you achieve the design points--do not be dogmatic. As you design, capture the trade-offs you are making and
    articulate them explicitly in your documentation.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    This is an iterative, developmental process. It is more like unraveling a mystery than solving a math problem. You will
    not achieve this in one attempt. It is very important to spread the work over several days so that the team can reflect
    on what they’ve done and generate new ideas for the next round. Record each iteration--good documentation of the
    evolution of the design can be very helpful during the review and approval step.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Keep focused on what is needed to implement and sustain the initiative that is driving the redesign. Stay in scope. If
    the new design has an effect on out-of-scope groups or elements of the management system, point out the implications
    but don’t attempt to redesign them.
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>The design must support the requirements of the organization (such as new technology and business processes). It includes

    Experience shows that it is important to get this scope right and to get it in focus at an early stage in the project
    while the other domains of redesign (process and IT) are also evolving. This allows the integration of redesign and
    implementation activities into the overall transition plan.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Most transformation projects require, as a minimum, the redesign of:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;div>
            Key job roles and responsibilities (in terms of activities, behaviors, and measurements) particularly those of
            process owners and key users
        &lt;/div>
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;div>

        &lt;/div>
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;div>

        &lt;/div>
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>&lt;p/>&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
    IBM and the client need to be very clear on what redesign will entail--the scope, the direction, and the risk. Anything
    that has been eliminated from the scope should be explicitly documented. If the client wants to carry out some redesign
    activities internally, this is the time to set clear expectations and devise an issue management approach to avoid
    resource conflicts. For multi-site or -function projects, there may be a need to conduct multiple reviews to gain
    agreement at the local level as well as the project level.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
    Review the analysis and recommendations with the client and probe for concerns, objections, and signs of resistance or
    faltering commitment. Test for their understanding of the possible implications of redesign. Ensure that you have their
    agreement to both scope and requirements before proceeding with redesign.

    This work product describes and gains agreement to:

        The elements (structure, behaviors, and enablers) of the organization to be addressed in redesign

        In a large project where multiple teams are working on different processes it is important to verify the detail and
        level of the documentation for consistency.&amp;nbsp; Since multiple people will be creating and writing the files,
        there is always a very high potential for the information to be documented at various levels of detail.&amp;nbsp; An
        example of a completed template should be provided, as well as, a quality check performed after each team member
        has completed one or two.
    &lt;/li>

    Performance appraisals and bonuses are sensitive issues. Therefore, anticipate resistance and be vigilant about reward
    systems that may run counter to your aims.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    It may be necessary to dismantle measures that encourage local optimization at the expense of the rest of the
    organization.&lt;br />
    Involve middle managers and supervisors early in the process and seek their buy-in. Begin by actively listening to
    their concerns and addressing the ones you can as quickly as possible before you ask for their support.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    In many redesigns it will become less possible and less necessary to hold individuals specifically accountable for
    overall outcomes. The greatest gains will often come from interdependence and teamwork.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    An effective Performance Management process is regularly scheduled and timely, and it is developmental. It reinforces
    superior performance and recognizes the achievement of goals. It corrects inferior performance and establishes
    performance improvements, and it ensures appropriate levels of training.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    With measures, some of the indicators will be very soft, while many will not be sourced from existing systems. Some
    data may come from external sources. Measures should be linked to SMART objectives, and goals should cascade down the
    organization. A good measure:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;div>
            Is accepted as being meaningful to the customer
        &lt;/div>

    &lt;li>
        &lt;div>
            Is part of a set of balanced metrics

    &lt;li>
        &lt;div>
            Is economical to collect and maintain

            Drives appropriate behavior
        &lt;/div>

    Once they are designed, validate the systems in a series of presentations and workshops with the interested
    communities:

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    The final test of success will be if the systems accomplish the client organization's goals and are accepted by
    employees. The best way to ensure this is to involve employees as much as possible from the start and to ensure that
    the results and reactions to the implementation of new performance management, measures, and rewards systems are
    monitored and the results fed back to amending the system if necessary.

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Management of the Business Case is extremely important. The Business Case is usually the primary documentation for the&#xD;
    justification of the project’s recommendations and the method the client will use to measure the ultimate benefits of&#xD;
    adopting those recommendations versus the current baseline. As such, it is essential to involve the client in all&#xD;
    aspects of Business Case. Early in the Business Case task, the Project Manager should meet with the Client Team Manager&#xD;
    and appropriate “client financial personnel”, to identify accepted client financial measurements and calculation&#xD;
    techniques; appropriate areas for consideration, as well as areas for non-consideration and proper client personnel&#xD;
    contacts and procedures. One of the main areas for non-consideration may be any claimed labor-savings if there is no&#xD;
    reduction in headcount. This must be discussed with the client management before allocating resources to the&#xD;
    calculations. Many times this type of labor cost saving is included as a “soft” benefit in the Business Case.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Case must be validated by the project team, as well as by client management and financial personnel.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    Attention should be paid to the Business Case being consistent with the design and implementation of the future&#xD;
    (&quot;Future&quot;) business processes.&amp;nbsp; The Project Manager must gain client agreement on the validation process early in&#xD;
    the Business Case task.&amp;nbsp; Any claimed benefits should have appropriate client management sign-off as to the amount,&#xD;
    timing and beneficiary area.&amp;nbsp; Lacking a true sign-off, the client management team must agree that the benefits are&#xD;
    reasonable and obtainable, and this agreement must be detailed in the report.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes the facts outlined in the&#xD;
    assumptions will change, causing the benefits to vary; however the client still expects the benefits to remain&#xD;
    constant.&amp;nbsp; Only by accurately capturing and maintaining current assumptions, consistent with the final&#xD;
    calculations, can client expectations be managed.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The scope of the Business Case work product addresses economic considerations associated with project recommendations:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        All identified &quot;hard&quot; benefits to the business, using an accepted, balanced and consistent financial evaluation&#xD;
        approach&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &quot;Soft&quot; benefits to the business, selected from among those identified&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Selected &quot;Quick Hit&quot; benefits to the client that can be identified and claimed based on the project, which may or&#xD;
        may not be solely due to the implementation of the recommendation&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The timing and order of recognizing benefits, based on a high-level implementation plan&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The costs of the recommendation, including (but not limited to) hardware, software and services, based on best&#xD;
        available information&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        All assumptions used in calculating the costs, benefits and schedule&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Case development process is iterative and continuous throughout the project. The Business Case outlines&#xD;
    how actual benefits or results can be measured, compared to existing metrics and benefits claimed, as recommendations&#xD;
    associated with each business process or function are implemented.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>
    The Estimated Preliminary Costs is usually the initial cost document for the discussion, planning and acquisition of
    the new system.&amp;nbsp; As such, it is expected that the original numbers will be approximates that are refined as the
    actual requirements become known.&amp;nbsp; Early in the Estimated Preliminary Costs task, the Project Manager should meet
    with the Client Team Manager and appropriate client financial personnel to identify and address the basis and purpose
    of the numbers.&amp;nbsp; Typically these numbers are “list” prices from the vendors and illustrate typical hardware,
    implementation and support costs.&amp;nbsp; During the final definition phase and negotiations these numbers may change
    significantly.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Other points of consideration:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Identify the project recipient of the estimated vendor costs and understand their confidentiality
        requirements.&amp;nbsp; Some clients do not want software costs to bias the functional scoring of the vendor packages
        while others used this information freely within the selection team to determine the vendor finalist.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Be explicit in all documents that use the vendor cost information from this Work Product and clearly state that
        these costs are estimates only and are not representative of the vendors actual software cost or cost to implement
        their solution.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Review the estimated preliminary costs with the IBM project manager before delivering this information to the
        client.&amp;nbsp; Some IBM managed projects may want to control the clients expectation for implementation and require
        the estimate include costs for “risk” or other “up-lifts” associated to the project as defined within the customer
        agreement.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Since the cost numbers are estimates only, round all final values to the nearest thousand.&amp;nbsp; Although clearly
        stated throughout this work product and highlighted in all the reports within the template, some clients may
        misinterpret the precision in the numbers and concluded that the costs are actuals.&amp;nbsp; The template for this
        Work Product already performs this level of rounding.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    The Estimated Preliminary Costs may be validated by the functional teams, the project team or by client management and
    financial personnel.&amp;nbsp; The values collected and presented should be checked for approximate scale, knowing that
    final values will be collected and negotiated later in the process.
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    The costs or estimated costs are the best available information given the level of knowledge of the installation, the
    estimated number of users, the number of interfaces/integration points with other systems, and other facts which will
    come to light during detailed study and planing tasks. The scope of the Estimated Preliminary Costs addresses:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        The estimated software costs to the client
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        The estimated hardware costs to the client
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        The estimated implementation and integration costs to the client

    Make sure you understand the level of change the client is looking for.&amp;nbsp; There is a lot of confusion in
    terminology surrounding business process re-engineering.&amp;nbsp; For example if the client says, &quot;we want radical
    redesign starting from a “clean sheet&quot; be sure you probe more to understand exactly what they mean.&amp;nbsp; Do they mean
    to change the boundaries of the process (e.g., question whether work should be performed in-house or outsourced, if
    work is to be moved to suppliers or customers) or are they just talking about a fresh approach to the processes within
    the existing boundaries?&amp;nbsp; Most clients cannot afford to completely throw away existing legacy systems and
    supporting processes.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
    Be aware that clients may have their own preferred definitions of terms and preferred approaches to various activities.
    An understanding of their industry and business is invaluable, e.g., being familiar with business terms and acronyms in
    common use.&amp;nbsp; Speak in terms they understand and that have the same meaning to all involved in the
    engagement.&amp;nbsp; Many times a client will confuse departments and organization with processes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />
    Choose approaches to activities that are comfortable for and acceptable to your client. Recognize that some may feel
    their jobs are threatened by process redesign efforts.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; And remember these words of caution.
&lt;/p>&lt;br dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot; />

        There is no single, correct definition of business process

    &lt;li>
        There is no single, correct approach to defining business processes within a client organization
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>&lt;br />
&lt;br />
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
    Coming up with an optimal solution is one thing.&amp;nbsp; The real tough part is gaining the buy-in from the client to not
    only accept the change, but feel they own that change. The steps in creating and developing the Process Definition, if
    done correctly, elicits this buy-in and provides a strong communication vehicle to foster sharing of knowledge.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
    Be sure you have the best people to participate from the client organization in order to obtain accurate
    information.&amp;nbsp; Their peers should respect them, as they will be called upon as change agents as the project
    progresses.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
    &lt;strong>Tips on Getting Started&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
        Establish a process team responsible for the design and modeling of each process.&amp;nbsp; The team should have a
        proper combination of experienced users, decision makers, package solution architects, technology specialists, data
        and application architects, and business consultants.&amp;nbsp; Conceptual thinkers and those familiar with the
        client's business strategy and technology strategy as well as customer wants and needs, are key members of the team
        who will help drive towards innovative solutions.&amp;nbsp; Those who are deeply engrossed in the current operational
        processes sometimes find it difficult to think of different approaches, however they do provide a sounding board
        for ensuring the new process is practical.&amp;nbsp; The secret is to find the right balance.&amp;nbsp; Process owners
        responsible for the business or IT process in the client's organization should also be included.&amp;nbsp; For package
        implementations, a package solution architect from IBM should be assigned and team members should have the
        necessary knowledge of the package or technology enablers.&amp;nbsp;
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
        Team skills must include the ability to facilitate group sessions, manage potential conflict situations, listen and
        reflect back descriptions provided by process experts, envision processes from the details available in documents
        and facilitated sessions, and the use of tools to record modeling results.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
        If process modeling software is to be used, it should be identified, agreed upon and used through all phases of the
        project.&amp;nbsp; It should be compatible with the design and configuration tools associated with any package being
        implemented. The value of using a modeling tool increases as the project progresses into the design, configuration
        and implementation phases saving valuable project time.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    &lt;strong>Considerations in Process Modeling&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    There are several techniques used in the actual building of the process flow. The detail descriptions of the various
    techniques are described in Technique Papers, some of which are currently under development.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Spending half a day &quot;walking&quot; through processes in scope, preferably following the sequence of activities, saves a lot
    of time later, whereas it provides credibility during interviews and workshops as well.&amp;nbsp; However, do the minimum
    amount of process modeling of the “&lt;strong>current” environment&quot;&lt;/strong> only sufficient to achieve the objectives of
    the engagement and provide a baseline from which to measure improvements and change.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    For processes classified as Basic or Industry Standard, design should be driven by the selected package's reference
    processes or by standard functionality of the selected technology enablers.&amp;nbsp; This ensures that the design will
    exploit the best practices built in to many of today’s package applications. At the same time, capability and
    performance requirements need to be met.&amp;nbsp; A useful approach is to create a “&lt;strong>baseline&lt;/strong>” model,
    which is used as a starting point for process analysis.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The approach to designing the “&lt;strong>future&lt;/strong>” process will depend on the nature of the engagement.&amp;nbsp; In
    many cases, this will involve implementation and integration of technology.&amp;nbsp; The process model should define the
    automation and information components that are consistent with those defined in the application and architecture work
    products.
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    The Process Definition work product is used to define how a business operates or would like to operate. A Business
    Process is a series of related cross-functional Process Steps that takes an input, adds value to it, and produces an
    outcome. Business process definitions help describe activities and expected results and are used by businesses to
    improve their operations and performance. This Work Product may be used to define and describe current, baseline
    (possible), or future processes. It is developed on an iterative basis with increasing levels of detail from a high
    level to the activity/work step/IT level.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    This work product may be used with the process identification work product, which describes the &quot;static&quot; state of
    process definition, as opposed to the &quot;dynamic&quot; flow of process activities. The process identification work product
    would define &quot;what&quot; the processes are, and the Process Definition would show &quot;how&quot; the work is performed in terms of
    the flow of work. This Work Product is used in conjunction with process capability definition, process capability
    enabling definition and the future process/function attributes work products to define and capture the details about a
    process, its capabilities and its enablers.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Process Flows are an effective means of communicating how work is performed in a time-based, cross-functional
    representation of the &quot;business logic&quot;. It shows things such as responsibility or work, collaboration between
    performers, branches in the process flow, results of key decisions, synchronization points where wait states must be
    resolved for the process flow to continue, and related instances of work that are performed throughout the end to end
    process.

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>
    Always make a softcopy of the drawing.&amp;nbsp; Marking up the client's existing hardcopy documentation or doing only a
    hardcopy drawing makes it difficult to share this information.&amp;nbsp; It cannot be easily sent to other team members,
    architects, etc. that may need to look at it.&amp;nbsp; Putting it in softcopy also gives you a start on additional work
    you might do on the facility such as an assessment or future design.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Make sure that you do not accept any client documentation without performing a walkthrough yourself.&amp;nbsp; Facility
    components are often updated on a regular basis and client documentation can become quickly out of date.&amp;nbsp; If you
    do not do the verification yourself, you cannot guarantee that the client's documentation actually represents what is
    in the facility.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    For engagements that are supporting systems architecture and design deliverables, make sure that you document the exact
    location of each component.&amp;nbsp; Placement is an important issue for these engagements and it is not sufficient to
    just understand what components are in the facility.&amp;nbsp; For selection, relocation or outsourcing decisions specific
    location information is not required.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The local Chamber of Commerce and/or Real Estate agents can be of assistance in gathering the environmental and
    external information points.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    A person with a strong facilities background, should write the major portions of the description.&amp;nbsp; Many of the
    sections relate to how the facility was originally built.&amp;nbsp; As-built drawings may have to be thoroughly reviewed in
    this effort.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />

    This work product will provide an inventory and description of everything within the current or planned client sites
    and facilities, and its location, as well as a description of a number of key external or environmental characteristics
    of the facility. This inventory and schematic are gathered for later evaluation against industry best practices in
    relation to the client’s facility requirements to support facility selection, design, enhancement, and relocation
    decisions.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The requirements should cover all facility components, effecting both man and machine. These requirements maybe
    internal to the site, such as:

    &lt;strong>Key Points&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        If the scope of the project is driven by the client's business strategies/goals and/or customer imperatives, output
        of the Process Assessment work product should directly support the process selection with rationale such as process
        performance and process importance in achieving business goals and / or customer sat.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        In a transformation project do not waste time at this stage in developing current process models / maps to a
        detailed level (identification of sub-processes (level 2) is sufficient to do an assessment, whereas level 3 (or 4)
        is required for analysis)
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        It is useful to get different views of importance / performance if you can, e.g. customers, suppliers, business
        partners, employees, etc.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Select the appropriate assessments based on client objectives / nature of the engagement, don't try and do them
        all!
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        The better you can prepare before the workshop, the more productive each workshop will be.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Use subject matter experts to minimize lost time and credibility.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Use the simple tools and techniques to help identify root causes; brainstorming, cause and effect (fishbone)
        diagrams, scatter diagrams, Pareto Analysis.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    &lt;strong>Approaches to business process redesign vary greatly. IBM’s business process design approach includes the
    following principles:&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Best Practices&lt;/strong> is the task of providing measurement and comparison to best industry practices to
        ensure that operations remain cost efficient. Benchmarking may also involve the examination of similar processes
        outside the industry in which the organization currently competes.&amp;nbsp;
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Operations assessment&lt;/strong> is a methodical process of analyzing how employee skill sets, business
        processes, and existing information systems function. The result is a comprehensive assessment of how effectively a
        company uses resources and how well its operating units perform.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Customer Alignment&lt;/strong> assesses the value of business activities as they pertain to customers to
        ensure that an organization is closely aligned with its customers’ specific needs.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>End-To-End Solutions&lt;/strong> analyze an entire process to discover more effective and efficient ways of
        handling it. Examine business processes across all functional and organizational boundaries (including customers,
        suppliers, and business partners) to provide a holistic view and maximum flexibility in optimizing the process.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Eliminate Non-Value Added Activities&lt;/strong> by identifying and eliminating any activities that do not
        provide value to either internal or external customers.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Time Compression&lt;/strong> reduce process time and overlap activities whenever possible. Speeding up
        business cycles can reduce costs and increase customer satisfaction that translates into increased revenue.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Organize Around Outcomes&lt;/strong> organize and measure people and processes around goals and outcomes not
        as series of intermediate steps.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    The appropriate process assessment/analysis should be selected based on the nature of the engagement. These include:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Importance (ranking) / performance (rating) assessment
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Maturity assessment to which degree existing processes have been implemented
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Criticality classification assessment
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Commonality (across multiple locations) assessment
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Placement (in-house vs. outsource potential) assessment
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Technology investment assessment
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Characteristics (for potential technology enablement) assessment
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        How well are the client processes integrated with the their partners’ processes (e.g. suppliers)of the value net

        The processes being analyzed must have already been defined, documented and mapped, showing key activities.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Use subject matter experts to minimize lost time and credibility.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Use the simple tools and techniques to help identify root causes; brainstorming, cause and effect (fishbone)
        diagrams, scatter diagrams, pareto diagrams.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Process flow diagrams are excellent vehicles to enable process analysis - they can be appended with cycle times and
        symbols to indicated problem areas or opportunities for improvement.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Try to do as much analysis at the activity versus the task level.&amp;nbsp; Note: an activity can be manual or
        automated and completes a unit of work.&amp;nbsp; A series of activities are linked together into a workflow to
        accomplish a sub-process that provides a discernible output.&amp;nbsp; Several sub-processes (e.g. provide product /
        service information, provide quotation, etc.) make up a process (e.g. agree contract).
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        There are often many problem areas, so it is key to prioritize these and only undertake root cause analysis on the
        top priority ones.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        There are usually many root causes, so it is key to understand how severe / to what extent these contribute to the
        problem areas.Then only brainstorm ideas to solve the top priority root causes.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Avoid getting bogged down in &quot;analysis paralysis&quot;.

        e-business is providing an opportunity to conduct business differently.&amp;nbsp; It is important to understand the

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>
    When facilitating the process or capability assessment exercise, allow client team members to use a more granular
    rating scale (i.e. L+, H-, etc.).&amp;nbsp; This will also help achieve a consensus opinion on the rating of each
    assessment category and goal linkage.&amp;nbsp; In some e-strategy engagements the assessment may be as simple as
    identifying it as a strength or weakness and then providing some descriptions as to the weakness and potential
    corrective actions rather than even doing high level process flows.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    If the scope of a transformation project is driven by the client’s business strategies/goals and/or customer
    imperatives, output of the &quot;As-Is&quot; Process or Capability Assessment work product should directly support the process or

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        This work product needs to be developed as a joint client/consulting team exercise, usually in a workshop. It is
        vital that all parties understand the issues, contribute to the discussion, and support the agreed position.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Accessibility standards should only be developed by someone knowledgeable and skilled in accessibility.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Security standards should only be developed by Methodology-trained Security professionals. Additional resources
        available in the IT Security ICAP Database.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        The documentation notation itself should conform to the established standards, e.g. accessibility.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    Standards provide the general “policy” level statements that are implementation-oriented and provide an auditable
    exception process. These sets of “rules” may make specific mention of technologies, methodologies, implementation
    procedures and other detail factors of the policy. A standard can be defined as something with a pre-described
    specification, that is measurable, recognized as having authoritative value, and which an organization chooses to
    implement as a basis for 'good practice'.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    These standards may have been determined by a previous study or may be de-facto or de-jure standards based on installed
    technology or management practices. The rationale, or source, of such determinations is documented for reference
    purposes. The work product also documents the implications of deviating from these standards. The deviation process
    itself will be documented as part of an overall management framework. Any significant components for which there are no
    established standards are also noted.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Standards can be developed from two viewpoints:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        From a corporate policy standpoint - in which case the standards will be enterprise-wide and technology independent
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        From an architectural standpoint - in which case the standards will be technology and product specific.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    Standards can be defined in many areas; the following ones are typical, dependent on the scope of a specific
    engagement:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Management standards
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Technology standards
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Application development standards
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Security standards
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Accessibility standards

    Having the right client participation is crucial to obtaining buy-in and thus the success of the entire effort. If you
    must delay the workshops to ensure the participation of the enterprise's thought leaders, then it is well worth it.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    After the initial workshops, both the principles and policies will undergo a widening circle of distribution. While
    this validation process must be tailored to individual client needs, it usually involves getting concurrence from all
    workshop participants, presentation to executives, and finally publication to the organization. A mechanism for
    updating the newly defined principles and/or policies should be devised as part of the overall management framework.
&lt;/p>&lt;p/>The definition of principles and policies should only be undertaken by suitable skilled practitioners, who have been
trained in one of the IBM Methods which specifically relates to this work product, for example, IT Strategy, Enterprise
Architecture, Security and IT Management - each of these disciplines has detailed guidance, technique papers and
samples/IC.</keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;b>Policy&lt;/b> - a high level statement of &lt;b>how&lt;/b> things will be managed or organized, including management goals,
objectives, beliefs and responsibilities. Policies are normally defined at an overall strategy level and can be related to
a specific area, for example, Security Policies, Management Policies. In many instances, policies reflect the law and
givens, which must be adhered to - this is especially true in the case of Security and Privacy policies. 
&lt;p>
    &lt;b>Principle&lt;/b> - defines the underlying general rules which an organization will use to utilize and deploy all
    business and IT resources and assets, across the enterprise e.g. &quot;IT systems will be designed to be capable of rapid
    expansion in line with unpredicted business growth.&quot;
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Principles should always include defined motivation and implication statements:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        The benefit statements highlight the value to the business of implementing the principle - and therefore provide a
        basis for justifying all related activities, for example, the implementation of an Enterprise Architecture, or the
        implementation of a Security Framework
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        The implication statements provide an outline of the key tasks, resources and potential costs to the business of
        implementing the principle. They also provide valuable inputs to future transition initiative and planning
        activities.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    Many different types and levels of Principles can be defined:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Guiding principles (normally 6 - 12) which provide an overall framework for decision making
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Business principles
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        IT principles (applications, data, technology, security, network, user interface, system management, development)
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Management and organizational principles
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Principles for mergers and acquisitions
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Principles for outsourcing
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    &lt;b>Guideline&lt;/b> - a general statement of direction, a desired future state which is not necessarily mandated.
    Guideline statements are similar in content to principle statements, but without the associated motivation and benefit
    statements.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    To be effective, all principles, policies and guidelines should be defined and agreed by both senior business and IT
    executives.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Once they have been agreed and published, the principles and policies provide a framework which can be used to explain
    and justify why certain business and IT decisions are being made, or need to be made.

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>
    Some critical success factors for developing this work product include:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
    &lt;li>
        Stay at as high a level as possible.&amp;nbsp; Do not waste time developing detailed process models or detailed
        descriptions at this point (include just enough description so people can agree on the boundaries and distinguish
        one process from another).
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Ensure that the differences between business management functions and processes are understood by IBM and the
        client.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        The number of businesses' processes should be around twenty to twenty five (if covering the entire enterprise) or
        between six and twelve (if covering the day-to-day business operations area) to achieve the right level of
        granularity.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Ensure a reasonably high level of consensus exists among client participants relative to the process names,
        descriptions, etc.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Identify potential sources of information before any client workshop, e.g., ICM database, ISU &quot;files&quot;, subject
        matter experts, competency networks; and through literature searches - competitive intelligence library at Mt.
        Pleasant, NY, Industry benchmark databases, industry consortiums, infogate, internet, etc; and within the client's
        organization in the form of prior work, operating guidelines, ISO or TQM documentation, etc.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Prepare a &quot;straw model&quot; of the processes/descriptions to be defined in the workshop.&amp;nbsp; This is a useful
        technique to ensure proper preparation and insight into the workshop focus area.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Whenever possible, start with a generic or industry standard process model (even if the client has his own model)
        to minimize development time and/or use as a benchmark for completeness and clarity.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Try to identify and involve the client's &quot;process architect&quot; or a fairly high level staff manager with broad
        knowledge of the client's business (who also understands business processes) to represent an objective view of the
        processes.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>
    &lt;strong>Major Dependencies:&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
    &lt;li>
        Client contact(s) with broad understanding of the business from a process perspective.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Involvement of client, vendor or IBM personnel with a general knowledge of the selected package's functional
        capabilities (if applicable).
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Knowledge of client's key business goals/objectives, customer imperatives and/or business process performance
        issues.
    &lt;/li>

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>
    Modeling business processes has no value in itself.&amp;nbsp; It provides the basis for understanding and analysis that can
    help clients identify opportunities to improve performance and operational effectiveness whether it’s through
    continuous improvement, re-engineering, repairing broken processes or transforming the business. The aim should be to
    help the client develop a process which:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Is responsive to executive goals
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Represents a fundamental rethinking of how work is done

        Integrates organization learning
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
    Make sure you understand the level of change the client is looking for.&amp;nbsp; There is a lot of confusion in
    terminology surrounding business process re-engineering.&amp;nbsp; For example if the client says, &quot;we want radical
    redesign starting from a “clean sheet&quot; be sure you probe more to understand exactly what they mean.&amp;nbsp; Do they mean
    to change the boundaries of the process (e.g., question whether work should be performed in-house or outsourced, if
    work is to be moved to suppliers or customers) or are they just talking about a fresh approach to the processes within
    the existing boundaries?&amp;nbsp; Most clients cannot afford to completely throw away existing legacy systems and
    supporting processes.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
    Be aware that clients may have their own preferred definitions of terms and preferred approaches to various activities.
    An understanding of their industry and business is invaluable, e.g., being familiar with business terms and acronyms in
    common use.&amp;nbsp; Speak in terms they understand and that have the same meaning to all involved in the
    engagement.&amp;nbsp; Many times a client will confuse departments and organization with processes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />
    Choose approaches to activities that are comfortable for and acceptable to your client. Recognize that some may feel
    their jobs are threatened by process redesign efforts.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; And remember these words of caution.
&lt;/p>&lt;br dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot; />
&lt;br />
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        There is no single, correct definition of business process
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        There is no single, correct approach to defining business processes within a client organization
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>&lt;br />
&lt;br />
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
    Coming up with an optimal solution is one thing.&amp;nbsp; The real tough part is gaining the buy-in from the client to not
    only accept the change, but feel they own that change. The steps in creating and developing the Process Definition, if
    done correctly, elicits this buy-in and provides a strong communication vehicle to foster sharing of knowledge.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
    Be sure you have the best people to participate from the client organization in order to obtain accurate
    information.&amp;nbsp; Their peers should respect them, as they will be called upon as change agents as the project
    progresses.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
    &lt;strong>Tips on Getting Started&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
        Establish a process team responsible for the design and modeling of each process.&amp;nbsp; The team should have a
        proper combination of experienced users, decision makers, package solution architects, technology specialists, data
        and application architects, and business consultants.&amp;nbsp; Conceptual thinkers and those familiar with the
        client's business strategy and technology strategy as well as customer wants and needs, are key members of the team
        who will help drive towards innovative solutions.&amp;nbsp; Those who are deeply engrossed in the current operational
        processes sometimes find it difficult to think of different approaches, however they do provide a sounding board
        for ensuring the new process is practical.&amp;nbsp; The secret is to find the right balance.&amp;nbsp; Process owners
        responsible for the business or IT process in the client's organization should also be included.&amp;nbsp; For package
        implementations, a package solution architect from IBM should be assigned and team members should have the
        necessary knowledge of the package or technology enablers.&amp;nbsp;
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
        Team skills must include the ability to facilitate group sessions, manage potential conflict situations, listen and
        reflect back descriptions provided by process experts, envision processes from the details available in documents
        and facilitated sessions, and the use of tools to record modeling results.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
        If process modeling software is to be used, it should be identified, agreed upon and used through all phases of the
        project.&amp;nbsp; It should be compatible with the design and configuration tools associated with any package being
        implemented. The value of using a modeling tool increases as the project progresses into the design, configuration
        and implementation phases saving valuable project time.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    &lt;strong>Considerations in Process Modeling&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    There are several techniques used in the actual building of the process flow. The detail descriptions of the various
    techniques are described in Technique Papers, some of which are currently under development.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Spending half a day &quot;walking&quot; through processes in scope, preferably following the sequence of activities, saves a lot
    of time later, whereas it provides credibility during interviews and workshops as well.&amp;nbsp; However, do the minimum
    amount of process modeling of the “&lt;strong>current” environment&quot;&lt;/strong> only sufficient to achieve the objectives of
    the engagement and provide a baseline from which to measure improvements and change.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    For processes classified as Basic or Industry Standard, design should be driven by the selected package's reference
    processes or by standard functionality of the selected technology enablers.&amp;nbsp; This ensures that the design will
    exploit the best practices built in to many of today’s package applications. At the same time, capability and
    performance requirements need to be met.&amp;nbsp; A useful approach is to create a “&lt;strong>baseline&lt;/strong>” model,
    which is used as a starting point for process analysis.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The approach to designing the “&lt;strong>future&lt;/strong>” process will depend on the nature of the engagement.&amp;nbsp; In
    many cases, this will involve implementation and integration of technology.&amp;nbsp; The process model should define the
    automation and information components that are consistent with those defined in the application and architecture work
    products.
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    The Process Definition work product is used to define how a business operates or would like to operate. A Business
    Process is a series of related cross-functional Process Steps that takes an input, adds value to it, and produces an
    outcome. Business process definitions help describe activities and expected results and are used by businesses to
    improve their operations and performance. This Work Product may be used to define and describe current, baseline
    (possible), or future processes. It is developed on an iterative basis with increasing levels of detail from a high
    level to the activity/work step/IT level.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    This work product may be used with the process identification work product, which describes the &quot;static&quot; state of
    process definition, as opposed to the &quot;dynamic&quot; flow of process activities. The process identification work product
    would define &quot;what&quot; the processes are, and the Process Definition would show &quot;how&quot; the work is performed in terms of
    the flow of work. This Work Product is used in conjunction with process capability definition, process capability
    enabling definition and the future process/function attributes work products to define and capture the details about a
    process, its capabilities and its enablers.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Process Flows are an effective means of communicating how work is performed in a time-based, cross-functional
    representation of the &quot;business logic&quot;. It shows things such as responsibility or work, collaboration between
    performers, branches in the process flow, results of key decisions, synchronization points where wait states must be
    resolved for the process flow to continue, and related instances of work that are performed throughout the end to end
    process.

    Use all information material provided by the client in the Request for Proposal (RFP) and other sources to glean the
    measurements that their organization currently collects, analyzes, and uses.

&lt;p>
    Where practical, create a measurements survey questionnaire based on the selected measurements from the measurement
    model and use it as a tool for capturing measurement information.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Try to determine why the client measures what they measure.&amp;nbsp; Which of their business goals, if any, do the

    (1)The term “measurement” as used in this document reflects the sorts of entities that must be elicited when defining
    and developing the measurement program and system for an organization. Generally, the term “measurement” can refer to
    either a computed metric, which involves a calculation among primitive metrics, or a primitive metric that reflects a
    directly observable or countable event or data point. The terms are defined as follows:
&lt;/div>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Measurement: A logical group of metrics whose collected data has at least one dimension of observation that can be
        normalized and presented to provide a cross-organization view of performance. A measurement is also one of a
        logical collection called a measurement category and can have several computed metrics associated with it.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Computed Metric: An entity, generally of a calculable nature, reportable to a client, to the target organization’s
        management, or to both. Computed metrics are, by and large, derived from two or more primitive metrics by a
        mathematical calculation or algorithm.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Primitive Metric: Countable entities or distinct observable events that are manifest in the processes and/or
        behaviors occurring in the measuring organization. In any implementation, the sampling for primitive metric data
        should be from the closest available point of service for the process or behavior being measured.&lt;br />

    &lt;li>
        Watch for redundancy.&amp;nbsp; Some events may be subsumed by others.&amp;nbsp; In such cases, you may choose to represent
        subsumed events as part of an aggregation of a larger-grained event.

        Consistent level of granularity may be difficult to achieve.&amp;nbsp; This isn’t a serious problem, as it will be

    &lt;li>
        Clarify which events are in or out of scope.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    Events&amp;nbsp;can be either&amp;nbsp;external or internal to the business, external events are performed by external involved
    parties (i.e. external entitites) that &quot;touch&quot; the business, while internal events&amp;nbsp;occur within the&amp;nbsp;target
    organization's business.&amp;nbsp; Some types of internal events are:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Dates (e.g. today is the 15th of the month)
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Conditions (e.g. 20 is the low stock level point)
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Incidents (e.g. a laptop is stolen)
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Life cycle events (e.g. employee leave)
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Decisions (e.g. an early retirement package is offered)
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Opportunities&amp;nbsp;(e.g.&amp;nbsp;another company is acquired)
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    Triggers actually cause the business to act. They represent the state change indicating that the event has taken place
    (uses past tense). For example:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Commercial customer complaint received (from the event &quot;commercial customer registers a complaint&quot;)
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        New business partner payment request received (from the event &quot;new business partner requests payment&quot;)
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Date reached (from the event &quot;today is the 15th of the month&quot;)
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Threat managed ( from the event &quot;threat agent attempts to access&quot; )

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A business rule defines a specific constraint or invariant that must be satisfied by the business. Business rules may&#xD;
    apply always (in which case they are called invariants) or only under a specific condition. If the condition occurs,&#xD;
    the rule becomes valid, and must therefore be complied with.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Note that a business rule is declarative, not procedural. It describes a desirable, possible state that is suggested,&#xD;
    required or prohibited. It may be conditional, that is, if something is the case, something else must or must not be&#xD;
    the case. It does not, however, describe the steps to be taken to achieve the transition from one state to another, or&#xD;
    the steps to be taken to prohibit a transition. [BRG 2000 - Business Rule Group &quot;Defining Business Rules ~ What Are&#xD;

    &lt;strong>Key Points&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        If the scope of the project is driven by the client's business strategies/goals and/or customer imperatives, output
        of the Process Assessment work product should directly support the process selection with rationale such as process
        performance and process importance in achieving business goals and / or customer sat.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        In a transformation project do not waste time at this stage in developing current process models / maps to a
        detailed level (identification of sub-processes (level 2) is sufficient to do an assessment, whereas level 3 (or 4)
        is required for analysis)
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        It is useful to get different views of importance / performance if you can, e.g. customers, suppliers, business
        partners, employees, etc.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Select the appropriate assessments based on client objectives / nature of the engagement, don't try and do them
        all!
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        The better you can prepare before the workshop, the more productive each workshop will be.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Use subject matter experts to minimize lost time and credibility.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Use the simple tools and techniques to help identify root causes; brainstorming, cause and effect (fishbone)
        diagrams, scatter diagrams, Pareto Analysis.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    &lt;strong>Approaches to business process redesign vary greatly. IBM’s business process design approach includes the
    following principles:&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Best Practices&lt;/strong> is the task of providing measurement and comparison to best industry practices to
        ensure that operations remain cost efficient. Benchmarking may also involve the examination of similar processes
        outside the industry in which the organization currently competes.&amp;nbsp;
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Operations assessment&lt;/strong> is a methodical process of analyzing how employee skill sets, business
        processes, and existing information systems function. The result is a comprehensive assessment of how effectively a
        company uses resources and how well its operating units perform.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Customer Alignment&lt;/strong> assesses the value of business activities as they pertain to customers to
        ensure that an organization is closely aligned with its customers’ specific needs.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>End-To-End Solutions&lt;/strong> analyze an entire process to discover more effective and efficient ways of
        handling it. Examine business processes across all functional and organizational boundaries (including customers,
        suppliers, and business partners) to provide a holistic view and maximum flexibility in optimizing the process.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Eliminate Non-Value Added Activities&lt;/strong> by identifying and eliminating any activities that do not
        provide value to either internal or external customers.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Time Compression&lt;/strong> reduce process time and overlap activities whenever possible. Speeding up
        business cycles can reduce costs and increase customer satisfaction that translates into increased revenue.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Organize Around Outcomes&lt;/strong> organize and measure people and processes around goals and outcomes not
        as series of intermediate steps.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    The appropriate process assessment/analysis should be selected based on the nature of the engagement. These include:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Importance (ranking) / performance (rating) assessment
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Maturity assessment to which degree existing processes have been implemented
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Criticality classification assessment

        Commonality (across multiple locations) assessment

    &lt;li>
        Placement (in-house vs. outsource potential) assessment
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Technology investment assessment
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Characteristics (for potential technology enablement) assessment
    &lt;/li>

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>
    Modeling business processes has no value in itself.&amp;nbsp; It provides the basis for understanding and analysis that can
    help clients identify opportunities to improve performance and operational effectiveness whether it’s through
    continuous improvement, re-engineering, repairing broken processes or transforming the business. The aim should be to
    help the client develop a process which:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Is responsive to executive goals
    &lt;/li>

        &lt;/ul>
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Integrates organization learning
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
    Make sure you understand the level of change the client is looking for.&amp;nbsp; There is a lot of confusion in
    terminology surrounding business process re-engineering.&amp;nbsp; For example if the client says, &quot;we want radical
    redesign starting from a “clean sheet&quot; be sure you probe more to understand exactly what they mean.&amp;nbsp; Do they mean
    to change the boundaries of the process (e.g., question whether work should be performed in-house or outsourced, if
    work is to be moved to suppliers or customers) or are they just talking about a fresh approach to the processes within
    the existing boundaries?&amp;nbsp; Most clients cannot afford to completely throw away existing legacy systems and
    supporting processes.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
    Be aware that clients may have their own preferred definitions of terms and preferred approaches to various activities.
    An understanding of their industry and business is invaluable, e.g., being familiar with business terms and acronyms in
    common use.&amp;nbsp; Speak in terms they understand and that have the same meaning to all involved in the
    engagement.&amp;nbsp; Many times a client will confuse departments and organization with processes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />
    Choose approaches to activities that are comfortable for and acceptable to your client. Recognize that some may feel
    their jobs are threatened by process redesign efforts.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; And remember these words of caution.
&lt;/p>&lt;br dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot; />
&lt;br />
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        There is no single, correct definition of business process
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        There is no single, correct approach to defining business processes within a client organization
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>&lt;br />
&lt;br />
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
    Coming up with an optimal solution is one thing.&amp;nbsp; The real tough part is gaining the buy-in from the client to not
    only accept the change, but feel they own that change. The steps in creating and developing the Process Definition, if
    done correctly, elicits this buy-in and provides a strong communication vehicle to foster sharing of knowledge.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
    Be sure you have the best people to participate from the client organization in order to obtain accurate
    information.&amp;nbsp; Their peers should respect them, as they will be called upon as change agents as the project
    progresses.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
    &lt;strong>Tips on Getting Started&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
        Establish a process team responsible for the design and modeling of each process.&amp;nbsp; The team should have a
        proper combination of experienced users, decision makers, package solution architects, technology specialists, data
        and application architects, and business consultants.&amp;nbsp; Conceptual thinkers and those familiar with the
        client's business strategy and technology strategy as well as customer wants and needs, are key members of the team
        who will help drive towards innovative solutions.&amp;nbsp; Those who are deeply engrossed in the current operational
        processes sometimes find it difficult to think of different approaches, however they do provide a sounding board
        for ensuring the new process is practical.&amp;nbsp; The secret is to find the right balance.&amp;nbsp; Process owners
        responsible for the business or IT process in the client's organization should also be included.&amp;nbsp; For package
        implementations, a package solution architect from IBM should be assigned and team members should have the
        necessary knowledge of the package or technology enablers.&amp;nbsp;
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
        Team skills must include the ability to facilitate group sessions, manage potential conflict situations, listen and
        reflect back descriptions provided by process experts, envision processes from the details available in documents
        and facilitated sessions, and the use of tools to record modeling results.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
        If process modeling software is to be used, it should be identified, agreed upon and used through all phases of the
        project.&amp;nbsp; It should be compatible with the design and configuration tools associated with any package being
        implemented. The value of using a modeling tool increases as the project progresses into the design, configuration
        and implementation phases saving valuable project time.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    &lt;strong>Considerations in Process Modeling&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    There are several techniques used in the actual building of the process flow. The detail descriptions of the various
    techniques are described in Technique Papers, some of which are currently under development.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Spending half a day &quot;walking&quot; through processes in scope, preferably following the sequence of activities, saves a lot
    of time later, whereas it provides credibility during interviews and workshops as well.&amp;nbsp; However, do the minimum
    amount of process modeling of the “&lt;strong>current” environment&quot;&lt;/strong> only sufficient to achieve the objectives of
    the engagement and provide a baseline from which to measure improvements and change.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    For processes classified as Basic or Industry Standard, design should be driven by the selected package's reference
    processes or by standard functionality of the selected technology enablers.&amp;nbsp; This ensures that the design will
    exploit the best practices built in to many of today’s package applications. At the same time, capability and
    performance requirements need to be met.&amp;nbsp; A useful approach is to create a “&lt;strong>baseline&lt;/strong>” model,
    which is used as a starting point for process analysis.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The approach to designing the “&lt;strong>future&lt;/strong>” process will depend on the nature of the engagement.&amp;nbsp; In
    many cases, this will involve implementation and integration of technology.&amp;nbsp; The process model should define the
    automation and information components that are consistent with those defined in the application and architecture work
    products.
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    The Process Definition work product is used to define how a business operates or would like to operate. A Business
    Process is a series of related cross-functional Process Steps that takes an input, adds value to it, and produces an
    outcome. Business process definitions help describe activities and expected results and are used by businesses to
    improve their operations and performance. This Work Product may be used to define and describe current, baseline
    (possible), or future processes. It is developed on an iterative basis with increasing levels of detail from a high
    level to the activity/work step/IT level.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    This work product may be used with the process identification work product, which describes the &quot;static&quot; state of
    process definition, as opposed to the &quot;dynamic&quot; flow of process activities. The process identification work product
    would define &quot;what&quot; the processes are, and the Process Definition would show &quot;how&quot; the work is performed in terms of
    the flow of work. This Work Product is used in conjunction with process capability definition, process capability
    enabling definition and the future process/function attributes work products to define and capture the details about a
    process, its capabilities and its enablers.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Process Flows are an effective means of communicating how work is performed in a time-based, cross-functional
    representation of the &quot;business logic&quot;. It shows things such as responsibility or work, collaboration between
    performers, branches in the process flow, results of key decisions, synchronization points where wait states must be
    resolved for the process flow to continue, and related instances of work that are performed throughout the end to end
    process.

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Management of the Business Case is extremely important. The Business Case is usually the primary documentation for the&#xD;
    justification of the project’s recommendations and the method the client will use to measure the ultimate benefits of&#xD;
    adopting those recommendations versus the current baseline. As such, it is essential to involve the client in all&#xD;
    aspects of Business Case. Early in the Business Case task, the Project Manager should meet with the Client Team Manager&#xD;
    and appropriate “client financial personnel”, to identify accepted client financial measurements and calculation&#xD;
    techniques; appropriate areas for consideration, as well as areas for non-consideration and proper client personnel&#xD;
    contacts and procedures. One of the main areas for non-consideration may be any claimed labor-savings if there is no&#xD;
    reduction in headcount. This must be discussed with the client management before allocating resources to the&#xD;
    calculations. Many times this type of labor cost saving is included as a “soft” benefit in the Business Case.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Case must be validated by the project team, as well as by client management and financial personnel.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    Attention should be paid to the Business Case being consistent with the design and implementation of the future&#xD;
    (&quot;Future&quot;) business processes.&amp;nbsp; The Project Manager must gain client agreement on the validation process early in&#xD;
    the Business Case task.&amp;nbsp; Any claimed benefits should have appropriate client management sign-off as to the amount,&#xD;
    timing and beneficiary area.&amp;nbsp; Lacking a true sign-off, the client management team must agree that the benefits are&#xD;
    reasonable and obtainable, and this agreement must be detailed in the report.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes the facts outlined in the&#xD;
    assumptions will change, causing the benefits to vary; however the client still expects the benefits to remain&#xD;
    constant.&amp;nbsp; Only by accurately capturing and maintaining current assumptions, consistent with the final&#xD;
    calculations, can client expectations be managed.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The scope of the Business Case work product addresses economic considerations associated with project recommendations:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        All identified &quot;hard&quot; benefits to the business, using an accepted, balanced and consistent financial evaluation&#xD;
        approach&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &quot;Soft&quot; benefits to the business, selected from among those identified&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Selected &quot;Quick Hit&quot; benefits to the client that can be identified and claimed based on the project, which may or&#xD;
        may not be solely due to the implementation of the recommendation&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The timing and order of recognizing benefits, based on a high-level implementation plan&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The costs of the recommendation, including (but not limited to) hardware, software and services, based on best&#xD;
        available information&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        All assumptions used in calculating the costs, benefits and schedule&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Case development process is iterative and continuous throughout the project. The Business Case outlines&#xD;
    how actual benefits or results can be measured, compared to existing metrics and benefits claimed, as recommendations&#xD;
    associated with each business process or function are implemented.&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>
    The Estimated Preliminary Costs is usually the initial cost document for the discussion, planning and acquisition of
    the new system.&amp;nbsp; As such, it is expected that the original numbers will be approximates that are refined as the
    actual requirements become known.&amp;nbsp; Early in the Estimated Preliminary Costs task, the Project Manager should meet
    with the Client Team Manager and appropriate client financial personnel to identify and address the basis and purpose
    of the numbers.&amp;nbsp; Typically these numbers are “list” prices from the vendors and illustrate typical hardware,
    implementation and support costs.&amp;nbsp; During the final definition phase and negotiations these numbers may change
    significantly.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Other points of consideration:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Identify the project recipient of the estimated vendor costs and understand their confidentiality
        requirements.&amp;nbsp; Some clients do not want software costs to bias the functional scoring of the vendor packages
        while others used this information freely within the selection team to determine the vendor finalist.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Be explicit in all documents that use the vendor cost information from this Work Product and clearly state that
        these costs are estimates only and are not representative of the vendors actual software cost or cost to implement
        their solution.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Review the estimated preliminary costs with the IBM project manager before delivering this information to the
        client.&amp;nbsp; Some IBM managed projects may want to control the clients expectation for implementation and require
        the estimate include costs for “risk” or other “up-lifts” associated to the project as defined within the customer
        agreement.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Since the cost numbers are estimates only, round all final values to the nearest thousand.&amp;nbsp; Although clearly
        stated throughout this work product and highlighted in all the reports within the template, some clients may
        misinterpret the precision in the numbers and concluded that the costs are actuals.&amp;nbsp; The template for this
        Work Product already performs this level of rounding.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    The Estimated Preliminary Costs may be validated by the functional teams, the project team or by client management and
    financial personnel.&amp;nbsp; The values collected and presented should be checked for approximate scale, knowing that
    final values will be collected and negotiated later in the process.
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    The costs or estimated costs are the best available information given the level of knowledge of the installation, the
    estimated number of users, the number of interfaces/integration points with other systems, and other facts which will

    Communications effectiveness can be partially determined by the level of organizational resistance to and acceptance of
    the project.&amp;nbsp; Appoint an individual or process team (who could be an extension of the core project team) to review
    the communications plan and to monitor its effectiveness.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A formal review cycle at key milestones of the

    the client organization as well as other stakeholders who need information (e.g., customers, suppliers). In addition to
    detailing the individual communication mechanisms, the Communications Plan work product has a work plan that details
    timing and responsibilities for preparation (including approval) and delivery.

&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Get client team consensus at every step.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Do not assign position titles to tasks; rather use skill categories that provide clearer definitions of required

        Validate configurations with vendors or subject matter experts.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Some or all of the above data (points 3,4) may need to be gathered to complete the infrastructure design. Use
        common sense in gathering information needed to complete the infrastructure design.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Ensure that any gaps identified during gap analysis are addressed in the project plan or are documented as addenda,
        issues, or action items in the overall project plan.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        If the gap analysis has determined that the project will require a very robust IT enterprise network, and major

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>
    The following list includes some indications when Benefit Impact Analysis is appropriate:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Employee performance is below what is expected/acceptable.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Job performance will be more closely tied to pay incentives and promotions.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Content/procedures are rapidly and/or continuously changing.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Job experts become novices transitioning from legacy to new workflow system.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        There is a high turnover rate.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Job functions need to be standardized and performance tracked.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Employees are not prepared for the current job (changing job requirements).
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Training time is too long.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Costs for current training are too high.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Employees are dissatisfied with current job-related tools and on-the-job support.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    Two reports on the cost-benefit/ROI of Intranet deployments illustrate how critical a cost-benefit analysis is to
    defining the success of the solution.&amp;nbsp; In a vendor-independent review of the costs and benefits of Intranet
    deployments across 55 businesses/ organizations ranging in size from $2 million to $35 billion, a significant
    correlation was found between Intranet ROI and type of application (META Group Consulting Report, 1997).&amp;nbsp;
    Organizations implementing publishing-only applications had significantly lower returns than those that provided
    dynamic and interactive capabilities, especially database access.&amp;nbsp; Benefits were generally achieved as a result of
    one or more of the following:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Headcount reductions
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        More rapid time-to-market for either new or existing products
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Reduced information printing, access, distribution, or management costs
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Increased productivity
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Improved customer or employee retention
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Increased employee collaboration/communication
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    IDC’s ROI case studies of five companies implementing Netscape Intranet solutions found ROI results ranging from 205%
    to 2,063% (with the average well over 1000%).&amp;nbsp; With payback periods ranging from &lt;u>6 to 12 weeks&lt;/u>, this study
    found the Intranet technology and solutions development investment to be unusually low as compared to other technology
    investments.&amp;nbsp; For example,&amp;nbsp;a leading supplier of electronic design automation software tools and professional
    services, focused its Intranet solution on supporting the work of sales representatives worldwide.&amp;nbsp; Sales
    representatives must have an in-depth understanding of the almost 1,000 products and services as well as the customer’s
    competitive business environment in order to provide effective consulting services.&amp;nbsp; The resulting Web-based
    solution maps each phase of the sales process (e.g., Identify Business Issues) with supporting materials and reference
    information using a home page with links to other pages, information sources, and custom applications.&amp;nbsp; The bottom
    line results for this company’s solution is:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Total 3-year costs: $1,423,133
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Total 3-year savings: $7,609,882
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Payback period: 0.15 years
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        ROI (over 3 years): 1,766%
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    The greatest impact on the benefits recognized in this significant ROI was due to the shortened learning time for new
    sales reps.&amp;nbsp; Reductions in the time for a new sales rep to become fully proficient ranged from 2 to 4
    months.&amp;nbsp; One new sales rep said that he “learned in 2 days from&amp;nbsp;the new company&amp;nbsp;what it took months to
    learn at a previous company.”&amp;nbsp; (IDC Report, 1997)
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        There are often other contributing factors to substandard job/task performance, such as inadequate pay and poor
        working conditions that cannot be remedied by any technical solution, no matter how exceptional it is.&amp;nbsp; It is
        important to identify and capture these other contributing factors that will need to be addressed with other
        solutions (e.g., business process solutions) in order to meet the organization’s needs and goals for success.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Usability success indicators are best satisfied through a rigorous, iterative user interface design and usability
        testing process built into the project life cycle from beginning to end.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        It is not always appropriate or accurate to report the ROI in a Benefit Impact Analysis since the ROI is derived
        from dollar value costs and benefits.&amp;nbsp; If the critical benefits are expressed as percentage (%) increase in
        productivity rather than dollar value or improved customer satisfaction ratings from “3” to “9,” for example, then
        the ROI calculation may not be appropriate.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        When calculating ROI is appropriate, be sure to work with financial staff to include all relevant values in the
        calculations (e.g., “discounted dollars,” “net present value.”)
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>It is critical that any financial “costs” and “benefits” are reviewed and validated by appropriate financial
personnel.</keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    The Benefit Impact Analysis work product includes the following information:
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    &lt;strong>Success Indicators&lt;/strong> – The business problem and critical needs of the business are analyzed and captured
    as goal statements based on perceived gaps between the current and desired state of business and individual performance
    (e.g., increase sales by 40%, reduce customer call time by 2 minutes).&amp;nbsp; The resulting “success indicators” are
    analyzed and categorized into five strategic perspectives.&amp;nbsp; They define the overall success criteria of the
    solution and help ensure that the criteria are met.
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Business Performance –&lt;/strong> This is the high-level view of the needs and issues of the business that
        contribute to the business need for new solutions.&amp;nbsp; Business performance is typically measured by executives
        and department heads in terms of overall operational costs and/or revenue to the organization.&amp;nbsp;
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Job/Task Performance –&lt;/strong> Job/Task Performance needs and success indicators must be further broken
        down into measurable success indicators derived from the Business Performance success indicators.&amp;nbsp; For
        example, to reduce turnover rate, it is necessary to uncover the underlying causes for high turnover rate among the
        employees/end users affected.&amp;nbsp; High turnover rates may have a number of related causes, such as poor job
        preparation resulting in less than adequate productivity and low job satisfaction among some employees.&amp;nbsp;
        Job/Task Performance success indicators can be uncovered by observing and interviewing representative managers and
        end users.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Training and User Support –&lt;/strong> Many Business Performance and Job/Task Performance success indicators
        point directly to training and on-the-job user support needs (e.g., reduce training time and costs, increase number
        of outputs produced).&amp;nbsp; This process involves conducting initial job/task analyses with representative experts
        and end users to define job roles and prioritize the tasks and requisite skills that fulfill job
        requirements.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Defining the Training and User Support success indicators involves an examination of the
        effectiveness of current training (e.g., classroom, computer-based training) and on-the-job support strategies
        (e.g., on-line help, on-the-job mentoring) as they relate to many of the identified Business Performance and
        Job/Task Performance success indicators.&amp;nbsp; Success factors, such as increase productivity, decrease errors,
        increase job satisfaction, or reduce training time and costs, all point to critical Training and User Support
        success indicators.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Usability –&lt;/strong> Usability success indicators are often identified as goals, or requirements, for the
        user interface design and job/task performance using the application.&amp;nbsp;
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Technology and Implementation –&lt;/strong> Although Technology and Implementation success indicators begin to
        define critical parameters about the solution, such as the delivery platform(s) and system performance, it is
        important to not focus on specific technical functional requirements too prematurely.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    &lt;strong>Benchmark Matrix&lt;/strong> – Using the list of success indicators as a guide, relevant quantifiable current and
    targeted measures of doing business that must be addressed by the solution are identified as benchmark measures in a
    matrix.&amp;nbsp; The targeted measures can be projected over predetermined intervals, such as 6 months, 12 months, and 2
    years.&amp;nbsp; Follow-up measures are included in the benchmark matrix for calculating the actual impact of the solution
    after implementation and roll out.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>People&amp;nbsp;Measures&lt;/strong>&amp;nbsp;- The people in the business are one of the greatest, and often
        costliest, assets, and it is their job/task performance that is often the focus of the solution.&amp;nbsp; The relevant
        personnel or user groups to be impacted by the solution are identified, and their costs to the business are
        quantified.&amp;nbsp; These costs are typically characterized in terms of compensation, including: 
        &lt;ul>
            &lt;li>
                Annual salary + benefits (often broken down into an average hourly rate)
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Bonus incentives
            &lt;/li>
        &lt;/ul>
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Compensation is used to quantify several people-related issues that impose costs to the business, such as: 
        &lt;ul>
            &lt;li>
                Training and/or retraining (e.g., may include trainee/employee compensation plus travel and costs for
                replacement help on their job)
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                On-the-job mentoring (e.g., may include costs for “time off task” for supervisors or other job experts who
                are frequently tapped, or interrupted, for job-related support for novice employees)
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Absenteeism (e.g., average number of days absent, cost of additional help)
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Turnover (e.g., usually expressed as a percentage rate and/or associated training and support costs for new
                hires)
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Grievances and/or conflicts (e.g., expressed as average or total number of employee grievances to be
                reduced by a specified percentage)
            &lt;/li>
        &lt;/ul>
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Productivity Measures -&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>Productivity measures are key to addressing both the business
        performance and user job/task performance strategic perspectives.&amp;nbsp; Productivity is typically measured as
        outputs or errors and can be quantified in terms of number, time, or quality. 
        &lt;ul>
            &lt;li>
                Outputs: 
                &lt;ul>
                    &lt;li>
                        Number (e.g., number of “widgets” produced, number of closed sales, number of orders processed)
                    &lt;/li>
                    &lt;li>
                        Time (e.g., time to produce one “widget,” sales cycle time from first contact to close)
                    &lt;/li>
                    &lt;li>
                        Quality (e.g., rated on a scale from 1 – low to 10 – high; the quality rating of a customer service
                        representative’s interaction with a customer; the quality rating of the product produced)
                    &lt;/li>
                &lt;/ul>
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Costs related to outputs may include not only the salary and benefits of employees, but bonus incentives
                for number, time, or quality of outputs.
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Errors: 
                &lt;ul>
                    &lt;li>
                        Number (e.g., number of customer complaints, number of rule/procedure violations, number of
                        accidents or outages)
                    &lt;/li>
                    &lt;li>
                        Time (e.g., time required to “fix” an error, nonproductive downtime)
                    &lt;/li>
                    &lt;li>
                        Quality (e.g., serious/high impact errors vs. minor/low impact errors)
                    &lt;/li>
                &lt;/ul>
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                It is often difficult to determine the actual dollar cost of an error (e.g., the cost of an accident in
                which lives were lost).&amp;nbsp; For many forms of “errors,” however, the cost can be based on the salary plus
                benefits for the person hours involved in “fixing” an error, for example.
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Environment Measures.&amp;nbsp; The environment measures addressed by the solution often involve technology and
                implementation-related factors, such as: 
                &lt;ul>
                    &lt;li>
                        Process for software, database, or online documentation maintenance and updating
                    &lt;/li>
                    &lt;li>
                        Publication and distribution costs
                    &lt;/li>
                    &lt;li>
                        Timeliness of job-related updates
                    &lt;/li>
                    &lt;li>
                        System response time
                    &lt;/li>
                    &lt;li>
                        Compatibility across delivery environments, workstation operating systems, and/or with other
                        software applications
                    &lt;/li>
                    &lt;li>
                        Support for employee communications and teamwork
                    &lt;/li>
                &lt;/ul>
            &lt;/li>
        &lt;/ul>
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    &lt;strong>Benefit Analysis&lt;/strong> – During the Benefit Impact Analysis process, five strategic perspectives are used to
    analyze and define the success indicators for the solution.&amp;nbsp; The strategic perspectives reflect the views of the
    solution from different stakeholders, such as executive, operations, finance, information systems, human resource
    development, and training and technical support.
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Targeted Benefits.&lt;/strong>&amp;nbsp; For the success indicators and the benchmark measures identified,
        relevant “benefits” are defined in measures and terms that are meaningful to the client.&amp;nbsp; The benefits
        measures typically represent a change from the current to the targeted measures identified in the benchmark
        matrix.&amp;nbsp; If predefined target intervals are included, the benefits measures would be stated as the change from
        the current to targeted measure 1 and the change from the current to targeted measure 2 (targeted benefit for Year
        1 and Year 2).&amp;nbsp; Benefits measures are expressed as any of the following changes: 
        &lt;ul>
            &lt;li>
                Dollar value (e.g., increase sales by $80,000 in 6 months and by $200,000 in 12 months as compared to the
                original sales figure).
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Percent (e.g., decrease errors by 20% in Year 1 and by 50% in Year 2).
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                Rate (e.g., increase customer satisfaction ratings from the current average of 4 – Acceptable, but not
                great to 9 – Excellent service on a scale of 1 – Unsatisfactory to 10 – Exceeded expectations, in the first
                year).
            &lt;/li>
        &lt;/ul>
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Solution Cost.&lt;/strong>&amp;nbsp; A key factor in calculating the ROI for a solution is the actual cost of the
        solution.&amp;nbsp; The solution cost must include the full range of components in the software application design,
        development, testing, and implementation, including performance support system, training, hardware/network support,
        and documentation.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;strong>Return on Investment (ROI).&lt;/strong>&amp;nbsp; Basically, ROI is the total dollar amount of the benefits
        compared to the total cost of the solution.&amp;nbsp; ROI can be expressed in three ways: 
        &lt;ul>
            &lt;li>
                $Total ROI Sum = $Total Solution Benefits Value – (minus) $Total Solution Cost
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                ROI Ratio = Total Solution Benefits Value: Total Solution Cost (e.g., 2:1)
            &lt;/li>
            &lt;li>
                ROI % = Total Solution Benefits Value&amp;nbsp; x 100 – Total Solution Cost&amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/li>
        &lt;/ul>
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></refinedDescription>

    When it comes to the assessment of the current application portfolio, there are various approaches that can be
    used:&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Some more sophisticated approaches to current portfolio analysis categorize the applications according to their
        importance and contribution to the business, These ideas, developed by McFarlan (1984) and extended by Ward and
        Griffiths (1996), make use of a 2x2 matrix to classify each application. The value of this approach lies in its
        simplicity (it is easy to get client staff to classify the applications into one of 4 categories) and the fact that
        it provides a high-level picture of the complete current portfolio that can be agreed by the different groups of
        stakeholders.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Combine the application and database questions. In older legacy environments that were developed without any view
        on sharing data through corporate databases - the two will be inextricably linked.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact&amp;nbsp;can take many forms: an assessment of the functional and technical quality of a client's installed&#xD;
    applications, databases and/or infrastructure.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    With respect to the applications, the assessment is focused on two complimentary views of functional and technical&#xD;
    quality (FQ / TQ as it is sometimes called). The former is concerned with both the extent to which the applications&#xD;
    support the critical business functions and the quality of that support. The latter is concerned with their technical&#xD;
    efficiency, (e.g. their age, stability, accessibility, reliability, maintainability) and the longer term technical&#xD;
    potential.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For database assessment, this work product is focused on data quality, (i.e. currency, redundancy, accuracy) and the&#xD;
    potential to support the future business strategies.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    With respect to the current infrastructure, the assessment is focused on technical efficiency, e.g. stability,&#xD;
    reliability, maintainability, age of installed base, support for critical business functions e.g. availability,&#xD;
    performance, accessibility, anticipated business growth and the longer term technical potential.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The scope of this type of assessment is usually limited to a subset of the application / database portfolio that is&#xD;
    judged to be the most important in terms of their support for the current business operations and their future&#xD;
    potential.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Any specific problems and opportunities associated with these applications, databases and infrastructure are captured&#xD;
    and documented as input to subsequent activities and work products&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An assessment of the efficiency, cost structure or competencies of the IS/IT organization and its management. This&#xD;
    often takes the form of general industry and peer group comparisons, using Industry standard models, IBM IT Comparison&#xD;
    Intellectual Capital and other external sources of material e.g. Gartner Group. Comparisons can be done in a number of&#xD;
    different areas:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        IT as a % of overall expenses, IT as a % of revenue&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Data Centre computing - utilized MIPS (or equivalent)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Departmental and personal computing - numbers of users&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Information capture and presentation - as a % of total IT costs&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Data Network - numbers of end-user stations supported&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Voice Network - numbers of end-user connections supported&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Application development and maintenance - as a % of total IT costs&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Help Desk - total calls per year handled&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Current IT department staffing and skills&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An assessment of the IS/IT organization’s capabilities, including:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The efficiency and effectiveness of current processes, policies, practices and management culture&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Whether the organization is structured and aligned effectively to support the business - including the required&#xD;
        linkages between departments&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Skills, resourcing policies&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Effectiveness of planning and implementation roll-out&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Assessments of this type can be conducted in several types of engagements:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        As part of a strategy level engagement - when it is normally the only assessment of IT that is undertaken&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        During the early stages of an Enterprise Architecture level engagement, to gain an insight into the overall age,&#xD;
        usage and gaps in the applications, data and infrastructure as an input to defining the requirements that are&#xD;
        captured in the EA model&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        During a detailed IT Infrastructure Management or Networking engagement&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        As part of an As-Is versus To-Be comparison to support migration from legacy to new systems. This migration often&#xD;
        occurs to take advantage of new technology and to support a new user group including people who require special&#xD;
        accessibility enablers.&#xD;

    Events&amp;nbsp;can be either&amp;nbsp;external or internal to the business, external events are performed by external involved
    parties (i.e. external entitites) that &quot;touch&quot; the business, while internal events&amp;nbsp;occur within the&amp;nbsp;target
    organization's business.&amp;nbsp; Some types of internal events are:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Dates (e.g. today is the 15th of the month)
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Conditions (e.g. 20 is the low stock level point)
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Incidents (e.g. a laptop is stolen)
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Life cycle events (e.g. employee leave)
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>

    (1)The term “measurement” as used in this document reflects the sorts of entities that must be elicited when defining
    and developing the measurement program and system for an organization. Generally, the term “measurement” can refer to
    either a computed metric, which involves a calculation among primitive metrics, or a primitive metric that reflects a
    directly observable or countable event or data point. The terms are defined as follows:
&lt;/div>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Measurement: A logical group of metrics whose collected data has at least one dimension of observation that can be
        normalized and presented to provide a cross-organization view of performance. A measurement is also one of a
        logical collection called a measurement category and can have several computed metrics associated with it.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Computed Metric: An entity, generally of a calculable nature, reportable to a client, to the target organization’s
        management, or to both. Computed metrics are, by and large, derived from two or more primitive metrics by a
        mathematical calculation or algorithm.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Primitive Metric: Countable entities or distinct observable events that are manifest in the processes and/or

    Modeling business processes has no value in itself.&amp;nbsp; It provides the basis for understanding and analysis that can
    help clients identify opportunities to improve performance and operational effectiveness whether it’s through
    continuous improvement, re-engineering, repairing broken processes or transforming the business. The aim should be to
    help the client develop a process which:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Is responsive to executive goals
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Represents a fundamental rethinking of how work is done

        &lt;/ul>
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Integrates organization learning
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
    Make sure you understand the level of change the client is looking for.&amp;nbsp; There is a lot of confusion in
    terminology surrounding business process re-engineering.&amp;nbsp; For example if the client says, &quot;we want radical
    redesign starting from a “clean sheet&quot; be sure you probe more to understand exactly what they mean.&amp;nbsp; Do they mean
    to change the boundaries of the process (e.g., question whether work should be performed in-house or outsourced, if
    work is to be moved to suppliers or customers) or are they just talking about a fresh approach to the processes within
    the existing boundaries?&amp;nbsp; Most clients cannot afford to completely throw away existing legacy systems and
    supporting processes.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
    Be aware that clients may have their own preferred definitions of terms and preferred approaches to various activities.
    An understanding of their industry and business is invaluable, e.g., being familiar with business terms and acronyms in
    common use.&amp;nbsp; Speak in terms they understand and that have the same meaning to all involved in the
    engagement.&amp;nbsp; Many times a client will confuse departments and organization with processes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />
    Choose approaches to activities that are comfortable for and acceptable to your client. Recognize that some may feel
    their jobs are threatened by process redesign efforts.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; And remember these words of caution.
&lt;/p>&lt;br dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot; />
&lt;br />
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        There is no single, correct definition of business process
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        There is no single, correct approach to defining business processes within a client organization
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>&lt;br />
&lt;br />
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
    Coming up with an optimal solution is one thing.&amp;nbsp; The real tough part is gaining the buy-in from the client to not
    only accept the change, but feel they own that change. The steps in creating and developing the Process Definition, if
    done correctly, elicits this buy-in and provides a strong communication vehicle to foster sharing of knowledge.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
    Be sure you have the best people to participate from the client organization in order to obtain accurate
    information.&amp;nbsp; Their peers should respect them, as they will be called upon as change agents as the project
    progresses.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
    &lt;strong>Tips on Getting Started&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
        Establish a process team responsible for the design and modeling of each process.&amp;nbsp; The team should have a
        proper combination of experienced users, decision makers, package solution architects, technology specialists, data
        and application architects, and business consultants.&amp;nbsp; Conceptual thinkers and those familiar with the
        client's business strategy and technology strategy as well as customer wants and needs, are key members of the team
        who will help drive towards innovative solutions.&amp;nbsp; Those who are deeply engrossed in the current operational
        processes sometimes find it difficult to think of different approaches, however they do provide a sounding board
        for ensuring the new process is practical.&amp;nbsp; The secret is to find the right balance.&amp;nbsp; Process owners
        responsible for the business or IT process in the client's organization should also be included.&amp;nbsp; For package
        implementations, a package solution architect from IBM should be assigned and team members should have the
        necessary knowledge of the package or technology enablers.&amp;nbsp;
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
        Team skills must include the ability to facilitate group sessions, manage potential conflict situations, listen and
        reflect back descriptions provided by process experts, envision processes from the details available in documents
        and facilitated sessions, and the use of tools to record modeling results.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
        If process modeling software is to be used, it should be identified, agreed upon and used through all phases of the
        project.&amp;nbsp; It should be compatible with the design and configuration tools associated with any package being
        implemented. The value of using a modeling tool increases as the project progresses into the design, configuration
        and implementation phases saving valuable project time.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    &lt;strong>Considerations in Process Modeling&lt;/strong>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    There are several techniques used in the actual building of the process flow. The detail descriptions of the various
    techniques are described in Technique Papers, some of which are currently under development.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Spending half a day &quot;walking&quot; through processes in scope, preferably following the sequence of activities, saves a lot
    of time later, whereas it provides credibility during interviews and workshops as well.&amp;nbsp; However, do the minimum
    amount of process modeling of the “&lt;strong>current” environment&quot;&lt;/strong> only sufficient to achieve the objectives of
    the engagement and provide a baseline from which to measure improvements and change.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    For processes classified as Basic or Industry Standard, design should be driven by the selected package's reference
    processes or by standard functionality of the selected technology enablers.&amp;nbsp; This ensures that the design will
    exploit the best practices built in to many of today’s package applications. At the same time, capability and
    performance requirements need to be met.&amp;nbsp; A useful approach is to create a “&lt;strong>baseline&lt;/strong>” model,
    which is used as a starting point for process analysis.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The approach to designing the “&lt;strong>future&lt;/strong>” process will depend on the nature of the engagement.&amp;nbsp; In
    many cases, this will involve implementation and integration of technology.&amp;nbsp; The process model should define the
    automation and information components that are consistent with those defined in the application and architecture work
    products.
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>
    The Process Definition work product is used to define how a business operates or would like to operate. A Business
    Process is a series of related cross-functional Process Steps that takes an input, adds value to it, and produces an
    outcome. Business process definitions help describe activities and expected results and are used by businesses to
    improve their operations and performance. This Work Product may be used to define and describe current, baseline
    (possible), or future processes. It is developed on an iterative basis with increasing levels of detail from a high
    level to the activity/work step/IT level.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    This work product may be used with the process identification work product, which describes the &quot;static&quot; state of
    process definition, as opposed to the &quot;dynamic&quot; flow of process activities. The process identification work product
    would define &quot;what&quot; the processes are, and the Process Definition would show &quot;how&quot; the work is performed in terms of
    the flow of work. This Work Product is used in conjunction with process capability definition, process capability
    enabling definition and the future process/function attributes work products to define and capture the details about a
    process, its capabilities and its enablers.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Process Flows are an effective means of communicating how work is performed in a time-based, cross-functional
    representation of the &quot;business logic&quot;. It shows things such as responsibility or work, collaboration between
    performers, branches in the process flow, results of key decisions, synchronization points where wait states must be
    resolved for the process flow to continue, and related instances of work that are performed throughout the end to end
    process.

    Experience shows that it is important to get this scope right and to get it in focus at an early stage in the project
    while the other domains of redesign (process and IT) are also evolving. This allows the integration of redesign and
    implementation activities into the overall transition plan.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Most transformation projects require, as a minimum, the redesign of:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;div>
            Key job roles and responsibilities (in terms of activities, behaviors, and measurements) particularly those of
            process owners and key users
        &lt;/div>
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;div>
            Cross-functional working patterns, team working, etc.
        &lt;/div>
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        &lt;div>
            The performance management system that motivates the new behaviors
        &lt;/div>
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>&lt;p/>&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
    IBM and the client need to be very clear on what redesign will entail--the scope, the direction, and the risk. Anything
    that has been eliminated from the scope should be explicitly documented. If the client wants to carry out some redesign
    activities internally, this is the time to set clear expectations and devise an issue management approach to avoid
    resource conflicts. For multi-site or -function projects, there may be a need to conduct multiple reviews to gain
    agreement at the local level as well as the project level.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>
    Review the analysis and recommendations with the client and probe for concerns, objections, and signs of resistance or
    faltering commitment. Test for their understanding of the possible implications of redesign. Ensure that you have their
    agreement to both scope and requirements before proceeding with redesign.
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>

    This work product describes and gains agreement to:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        The geographies, divisions, and levels to be addressed in redesign
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        The elements (structure, behaviors, and enablers) of the organization to be addressed in redesign
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Organization design points that outline the principal changes to be made
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        The cost, risks, and expected value of meeting the proposed design points
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>&lt;p/>&lt;p>
    The report should be discussed and reviewed extensively with the client, and agreement with it forms the basis for all
    future organization design work.

&lt;p>
    Communications effectiveness can be partially determined by the level of organizational resistance to and acceptance of
    the project.&amp;nbsp; Appoint an individual or process team (who could be an extension of the core project team) to review
    the communications plan and to monitor its effectiveness.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A formal review cycle at key milestones of the

    &lt;li>
        Get client team consensus at every step.

    (1)The term “measurement” as used in this document reflects the sorts of entities that must be elicited when defining
    and developing the measurement program and system for an organization. Generally, the term “measurement” can refer to
    either a computed metric, which involves a calculation among primitive metrics, or a primitive metric that reflects a
    directly observable or countable event or data point. The terms are defined as follows:
&lt;/div>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Measurement: A logical group of metrics whose collected data has at least one dimension of observation that can be
        normalized and presented to provide a cross-organization view of performance. A measurement is also one of a
        logical collection called a measurement category and can have several computed metrics associated with it.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Computed Metric: An entity, generally of a calculable nature, reportable to a client, to the target organization’s
        management, or to both. Computed metrics are, by and large, derived from two or more primitive metrics by a
        mathematical calculation or algorithm.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Primitive Metric: Countable entities or distinct observable events that are manifest in the processes and/or
        behaviors occurring in the measuring organization. In any implementation, the sampling for primitive metric data
        should be from the closest available point of service for the process or behavior being measured.&lt;br />
